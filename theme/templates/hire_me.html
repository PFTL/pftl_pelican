            <p class="font-sans text-xl pb-3">
                I have more than a decade of experience developing software for complex
                scientific instruments, with real-time data analysis options, and User-Interface design. <br/>
                I have worked on projects ranging from automating <span class="font-bold text-sky-800">measurement benches</span>,
                to building software for <span class="font-bold text-sky-800">microscopy</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-xl">
                I also have a background as an <span class="font-bold text-sky-800">entrepreneur</span>, which means I
                can help you focus on the key features your
                customers want. Are you building an <span class="font-bold text-sky-800">MVP</span>? Rest assured we

            <p class="font-sans text-xl pb-3">
                After the initial discussion, we lay out a plan. It includes milestones and timelines. It is also
                important
                to have clear deliverables, such as reports, presentations, or meetings with different stakeholders.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans text-xl pb-3">
                Most projects (but not all) specify the total number of hours allocated. I will keep you informed on the
                progress, and remaining time budget so you can prioritize tasks according to your needs. <span
                    class="font-bold text-sky-800">Transparency</span> is a core tenant of my way of working.
            </p>
            <p class="font-sans pb-3">
                I am based in <span class="font-bold text-sky-800">Paris, France</span>. Depending on the size of the
                project, I am willing to periodically commute to your location. Ideally, most of the time I'll engage in
                remote interactions with your team members.

        <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-sans leading-tight pb-1">
           I was contacted by the CEO of a company that works in instruments for medical equipment testing, a highly
            regulated environment. The question was very concrete: what is the <span class="font-bold text-sky-800">smartest way to transition to Python</span>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-bold font-serif text-2xl pb-1">The process</h3>
        <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-sans leading-tight pb-1">
        we set up the project as weekly meetings over a period of a month. During those meetings, we would discuss about
            the current implementation, and I would use the in between time to research and prototype some solutions. </p>
        <h3 class="font-bold font-serif text-2xl pb-1">The solution</h3>
        <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-sans leading-tight pb-1">
        Implementing the acquisition software directly in the instruments, leveraging FastAPI, and multi-processing. A
            server with access to the LAN would keep experiment records and data, ensuring compliance.

        <h3 class="font-bold font-serif text-2xl pb-1">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-sans leading-tight pb-1">
            A <span class="font-bold text-sky-800">microscopy company</span> needed a reality check to ensure that their
            software development efforts were aligned with best practices and future-proof.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-bold font-serif text-2xl pb-1">The process</h3>
        <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-sans leading-tight pb-1">
            We set up a couple of sessions with the in-house developers to discuss the code, the management, and
            the future. In total, we spent about 10 hours going through the code base and the challenges.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-bold font-serif text-2xl pb-1">The deliverables</h3>
        <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-sans leading-tight pb-1">
            I delivered a detailed report on the team composition and future threats such as lack of engagement, lack of
            long-term vision.<br />
            I also provided an overview of elements to improve in the code architecture, efficiency, and documentation. <br />
            More importantly, I also delivered a <span class="font-bold text-sky-800">strategic plan</span> focusing on
            a detailed SWOT analysis, and alternative paths.

        <h3 class="font-bold font-serif text-2xl pb-1">The Challenge</h3>
        <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-sans leading-tight pb-1">
            A startup needed software to control a complex instrument. The challenge included electronics control, fast
            data acquisition, analysis, and storage.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-bold font-serif text-2xl pb-1">The process</h3>
        <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-sans leading-tight pb-1">
            The company didn't have a software developer, but the CTO was a capable programmer. <br />
            Since this was an ambitious project, we organized it as a long-term commitment, with a dedicated number of
            hours per week. I estimated the total length of the project, and there would be a half-way evaluation.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-bold font-serif text-3xl pb-1">The Outcome</h3>
        <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-sans leading-tight pb-1">
            Together with the CTO of the company, we defined the specifications of the software, and agreed on a multi-step
            approach to quickly test with users and iterate based on their feedback.<br />
            Instead of developing software myself, we agreed that hiring a developer in-house would be the best solution.<br />
            I focused on coaching and managing the person and project. This was the best approach to keep costs constraint,
            and achieve a speedy delivery.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-xl font-sans leading-tight pb-1">
            In just over 2 months, a first version of the software was ready to test with users. The initial feedback
            was instrumental to plan improvements on the UX, and to implement them as quickly as possible. <br />
            The production version of the code was completed and shipped to customers in just under 6 months, much
            earlier than the expected 1-year timeline the company initially had.
