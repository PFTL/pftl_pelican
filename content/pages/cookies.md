Python for the Lab stores only necessary cookies on your computer. We do not use them to track or analyze your behavior. We store one cookie called csrftoken which is necessary to provide security when submitting forms through the internet (for example when you submit a comment, subscribe to a newsletter, etc.). This cookie prevents a type of attack known as cross site request forgery, which would allow another page to submit a form as if it would be you on our website.

Another cookie we store is sessionid , however, this cookie will be stored only if you log in to our website. For example, if you would like to upvote or downvote comments, you will need to be logged in. This is the only way in which the server can know who you are and grant you access.

We do not store third party cookies on your computer, and we do not give access to your information (personal or not) to any third parties.
