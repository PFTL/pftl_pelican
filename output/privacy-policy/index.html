This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Python For The Lab and how we use it.<p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us through email at aquiles@pythonforthelab.com<h2>Data Collection</h2><p>We value your privacy as much as our own. Therefore, Python for the Lab is committed at making the internet a better place. We only store strictly necessary cookies, which are used only for security or functionality, you can check our cookie policy to know more about it. By default, we do not store any personally identifiable information on our logs. We use Privalytics.io to build statistics on where users come from and which articles are more popular. In no way Privalytics (which is a tool developed by ourselves) tracks user behavior across websites nor stores cookies.<p>The only data we collect from users is the one they decide to share with us, such as their e-mail when subscribing to the newsletter or when they request a free sample chapter of our books. The data includes the IP that originated the request, the e-mail and a timestamp. We comply with GDPR rules by granting every user the basic online rights: to amend, to forget, to be informed, to access, to rectify, to erasure, to restrict processing, to data portability, and to object. We believe that these are the basic rights that every person should have irrespective of their origin.<p>We also store data when leaving comments on the articles. This data includes the e-mail and name of the user, but also their IP address. We need to store this information in order to fight spam and make the moderation processes more reliable. In no way Python for the Lab transfers any data to external providers.<h2>Data Retention</h2><p>E-mails collected for the purpose of signing up to the newsletter or for requesting free sample chapters are stored for up to a year on our database. When that period elapses, an e-mail will remind each user of their subscription in order to make an informed decision of whether to remain in our database or not. We retain the information supplied while commenting on articles for an indefinite period of time.<h2>Data Sharing</h2><p>We won't share any personal data with third parties nor visitors of Python for the Lab, unless you give us explicit permission to do so. For example, by leaving a testimonial on one of our workshops or books. We do not share any information with third parties for processing.<h2>Children's information</h2><p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.<p>Python For The Lab does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13.
