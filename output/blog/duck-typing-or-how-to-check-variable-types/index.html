            <main>
              <p>The name duck typing has its root in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">the
expression</a> <em>If it walks like
a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck</em>. Which means
that if you want to know whether you are dealing with a duck or not, you
only care about how it looks like and how it behaves rather than
actually checking to what species the animal belongs.</p>
<p>The code that we develop in this article is available <a href="https://github.com/PFTL/website/tree/master/example_code/33_duck_typing">on
Github</a>.</p>
<p>The analogy translates <em>almost</em> literally to Python. Python is a
dynamically typed language. This means that you don't need to specify
what type of variables you are dealing with. The following lines are
perfectly valid Python code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">var1 = 'This is a string'
var1 = 1
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see above, <code>var1</code> changed from a string to an integer without
any problems. We didn't need to specify whether <code>var1</code> was going to be
of either type. Without going to the details about what variables truly
mean in Python, we can see that it is very convenient because it saves
us from a lot of typing. On the other hand, it means that we can't be
sure what variable type a function will receive until an error is
raised, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def increase_by_one(value)
    return value + 1
</code></pre>
<p>If we run the function <code>increase_by_one</code> with <code>var1</code> it will work only
if <code>var1</code> is a number (integer or float), but it will give us a
<code>TypeError</code> if we run it with a string. Statically typed languages would
have warned us about this problem at compilation time and would have
prevented us from some headaches down the line.</p>
<p>One easy solution would be to check whether the <code>value</code> is either an
integer or a float. We can improve our function, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def increase_by_one(value):
    if isinstance(value, int) or isinstance(value, float):
        return value + 1
</code></pre>
<p>If we try to run the function with a string, it will not do anything and
it will return <code>None</code>. If we run the function with either an integer or
a float, it will return the value increased by one. This behavior is
more or less what we would expect.</p>
<h2>What is duck typing?</h2>
<p>So, you may wonder after this long preamble, what is actually duck
typing. Imagine that we now have a numpy array, and we use the function
<code>increase_by_one</code> with it, what do you expect to happen?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

var1 = np.array((0, 1, 2))
print(increase_by_one(var1))
</code></pre>
<p>You get <code>None</code>, but is that what you were expecting? If you think about
it, we forced the output because we designed the function to only work
on integers and floats, while an array is neither of them. However, if
we go back to the old version of the function before we implemented the
verification, we would get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def increase_by_one(value):
    return value + 1

print(increase_by_one(var1))
# [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the function <code>increase_by_one</code> works also on arrays.
The idea of <strong>duck typing</strong> is that we don't care about what type of
variable <code>value</code> is, provided that we can add 1 to it. In Python, this
is translated to try to add 1 to <code>value</code> and if an exception is raised,
we deal with it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def increase_by_one(value):
    try:
        value += 1
    except TypeError:
        return None
    return value
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the function will run with all types of variables which accept
being added by one. At the beginning we assumed only floats and integers
were able to be added by one, then we found that numpy arrays are also
working, and you can find that there are even more possibilities around.</p>
<h2>Custom Classes</h2>
<p>Duck typing becomes crucial when you develop your custom classes. Python
exposes a lot of syntactic sugar which allow you to customize how things
behave under certain operations. To keep up with the example above,
let's develop a class which allows being increased by one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class AddOne:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = str(value)

    def __add__(self, other):
        self.value += str(other)
        return self

    def __str__(self):
        return self.value
</code></pre>
<p>And we can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">var1 = AddOne('0')
print(increase_by_one(var1))
# 01
</code></pre>
<p>What you see now, is that our class defines the behavior of adding. In
this case, the class will concatenate whatever value we add to the
initial string that we have defined. That is why we see that the output
is <code>01</code>.</p>
<p>Duck typing means that our function will run every time there is a way
of adding a <code>1</code> to the object. The example in these sections is almost
trivial, so we can see something which is much more relevant.</p>
<h2>Complex Data Structures</h2>
<p>When you develop larger programs, it is almost impossible not to need
configuration variables. Storing configuration parameters in
dictionaries is very handy because it is very explicit. Let's make it
very simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">configuration = {
    'param1': 10,
    'param2': 5
}
</code></pre>
<p>And we also develop an Experiment class, which will use the
configuration and will verify whether we have supplied all the needed
parameters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Experiment:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.configuration = config

    def check_config(self):
        if not {'param1', 'param2'} &lt;= set(self.configuration.keys()):
            raise Exception('The configuration does not include the mandatory fields')
        print('Config seems OK')
</code></pre>
<p>You see that we have developed <code>check_config</code> which uses sets to check
whether both parameters are within the keys of the dictionary. In other
words, we verify whether the set <code>{'param1', 'param2'}</code> is a subset of
all the keys in the configuration.</p>
<p>We can add one last method to check whether the parameters are within an
acceptable range:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def check_config_range(self):
    if self.configuration['param1'] &gt; 10:
        raise Exception('param1 cannot be larger than 10')
    if self.configuration['param2'] &gt; 5:
        raise Exception('param2 cannot be larger than 5')
    print('Range seems OK')
</code></pre>
<p>You can test the code by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">exp = Experiment(configuration)
exp.check_config()
exp.check_config_range()
</code></pre>
<p>So, where does duck typing come into effect?. In the code above we have
assumed that the configuration would be a dictionary, but we are not
bound to that. Imagine that we want to improve how we deal with
configurations. We can develop our custom class to handle the reading
from a file, perhaps logging changes to parameters, etc. And we want it
to be compatible with the <code>Experiment</code> class that we have already
developed. Therefore, the duck-typing here works the other way around.
We know what the class needs in order to work properly, we just develop
a solution around it.</p>
<p>If you look at the code of <code>Experiment</code>, you see that it uses the
configuration in two different places. First, when it checks that both
<code>param1</code> and <code>param2</code> are present, through the method <code>keys</code>. We know
that we will need a class that supports that method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Config:
    def __init__(self):
        ...

    def keys(self):
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>We also know that when we want to use the parameters, we access them
through <code>configuration['param1']</code>, and to achieve this, we will need to
tweak the magic method <code>__getitem__</code>. Let's add one more requirement,
and is that we want to instantiate this class with a filename, which
will be read by the class and the data will be loaded. For simplicity,
we force the configuration file to be in YAML format. Thus, our <code>Config</code>
class will look like this (you need pyyaml installed for this to work):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import yaml

class Config:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            self._config = yaml.load(f.read(), Loader=yaml.FullLoader)

    def keys(self):
        return self._config.keys()

    def __getitem__(self, item):
        return self._config[item]
</code></pre>
<p>If we go step by step, you can see that when we instantiate the class,
we ask for a filename, which we will open and we will load its contents
into an attribute called <code>_config</code>. Note that Python doesn't have true
private attributes for classes (i.e. attributes that can be accessed
only within the class but not from outside). As a convention, attributes
starting with an underscore, such as <code>_config</code> signal that they are not
supposed to be used directly, but we can't easily enforce it.</p>
<p>Since <code>_config</code> will be a dictionary, the implementation of the <code>keys</code>
method will be trivial, we just use the default dictionary method.
<code>__getitem__</code> is, however much more interesting. The <code>__getitem__</code>
method in Python is the one that regulates what happens when you do
something like <code>c['param1']</code>. <code>item</code> in this case will be <code>param1</code>, and
we want to retrieve that item from the <code>_config</code> dictionary. If you want
to test this implementation, first, you need to create a file
<strong>config.yml</strong> with the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">param1: 10
param2: 5
</code></pre>
<p>And then you can run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">c = Config('config.yml')
print(c['param1'])
print(c['[param2'])
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, if you would like to change the value of 'param1' or
'param2', you will get an error. Covering this topic is beyond duck
typing, so keep tuned because we are going to discuss it in a later
tutorial.</p>
<p>Now we can put everything together, our custom configuration class and
the experiment class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">c = Config('config.yml')
exp = Experiment(c)
exp.check_config()
exp.check_config_range()
</code></pre>
<p>Now you see that you are running the <code>Experiment</code> with a configuration
which is not a dictionary but a custom designed class, and it works as
expected.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>If you look for the definition of duck typing, you will typically find
that in Python, it is common not to verify to which data type a variable
belongs. If those variables behave as expected, then you shouldn't
worry. In the beginning, we saw that this is very handy because it
allowed us to use a function on variables which we didn't originally
intend, such as numpy array or custom classes.</p>
<p>In the second part, we saw that you can plan your code the other way
around. If you assume that duck typing is a common practice (i.e. that
the libraries you use don't verify the type of variables, but only their
functioning), you can design your own classes in such a way that they
behave as a specific data type. Our example was a class that mimics how
dictionaries work, and which we used as an argument in a different
object, which had no idea of our custom data type.</p>
