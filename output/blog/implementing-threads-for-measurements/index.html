              <p>Probably you have run into the problem of wanting to update a plot while
acquiring a signal, but finding that Python is busy during the
acquisition. This happens, for example, when functions or methods take
long to execute and you can't regain control until it is done. Python
has at least two different ways of solving this issue, one is the
<strong>threading</strong> module and the other is the <strong>multiprocessing</strong> module.
They look the same but are fundamentally different, and therefore you
need to understand their differences in order to decide when to use one
or the other.</p>
<h2>A Simple Measurement Class</h2>
<p>First, let's build a simple measurement class to simulate what you would
normally find when performing an experiment. Imagine that you would like
to measure Ohm's law, i.e. the current that flows through a circuit as a
function of the voltage applied to it. We can create a class for the
measurement and within it, we can define a method to gather results.
Later it will become clear why we use a class instead of just a
function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
from time import sleep

class OhmLaw:
    def make_measurement(self, start, stop, num_points, delay):
        x_axis = np.linspace(start, stop, num_points)
        data = []
        for i in x_axis:
            # Acquire fake data
            data.append(np.random.random())
            sleep(delay)

        return data
</code></pre>
<p>This is a toy example, in which the data is randomly generated and we
are not really using the input parameters at all, but it shouldn't be
too hard to relate this to what you normally do in your lab. If you want
to run the code, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ohm = OhmLaw()
result = ohm.make_measurement(0,1,11,1)
print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, as soon as the code reaches the highlighted line, it
will hang until all the data is generated. This is a very common
scenario when the measurement is actively controlled by the computer. In
the example above you may wait for 10 seconds, which is not too bad, but
normally you would like to see the progress of your experiment in order
to decide how to continue.</p>
<h2>Running the measurement in a non-blocking way</h2>
<p>The first way of solving the issue is to run the measurement in the
background. This will allow you to continue with the execution of the
code after you have called <code>make_measurement</code>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>When you start dealing with threads, you will find yourself in the
situation of having a program that is running an infinite loop and
therefore it will never finish. <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>C</strong> is your best friend to
stop the execution.</p>
</div>
<p>The easiest way to achieve this behavior in Python is by using the
<strong>threading</strong> module. Let's first see how to implement our solution and
then we can go into the details.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import threading

ohm = OhmLaw()

t = threading.Thread(target=ohm.make_measurement, args=(0,1,11,1))
t.start()
print('Triggered measurement')
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the code above, what you will see is that right after
starting the thread, the <code>print</code> statement is executed. You will also
notice that the program, even if it reached the end, is waiting for the
thread <code>t</code> to be complete before exiting. We can add a bit more of
action in order to realize what is happening:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import threading
ohm = OhmLaw()

t = threading.Thread(target=ohm.make_measurement, args=(0,1,11,1))
t.start()
print('Triggered measurement')
i = 0
while t.is_alive():
    i += 1
    print('Acquiring {}\r'.format('.'*i), end=' ')
    sleep(0.5)
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the code, you will see on the screen the message 'Acquiring'
with an incrementing number of dots. If you add a print statement to the
<code>make_measurement</code> method, you will see that it gets interleaved into
the output. You can already see that there are two different tasks
running at the same time. On one hand, you have the <code>make_measurement</code>
method that takes longer to run, on the other you are refreshing the
screen every half a second. But it is time to learn a bit more about
what are the threads we have just created.</p>
<h2>What are Threads</h2>
<p>A crucial component of every computer is its processor. It is the piece
of hardware that makes all the calculations and decisions. You probably
know that the amount of computations per unit of time that a processor
can perform is limited. That is why some programs take longer to open,
or complex code takes longer to complete. However, you may have noticed
that on your computer several programs can be performing tasks
simultaneously. This is thanks to the operating system, which iterates
through different programs in order to keep them all responding.</p>
<p>Within Python, the same functionality can be achieved. Each thread is
nothing more than a Python program interpreter running specific tasks.
Each program will have a main thread and you may spawn child threads
from within it, as you have seen above. This means that in the line
where you define <code>threading.Thread</code>, what you are actually doing is
creating a new python interpreter within your own program, and that
interpreter will be running the method <code>make_measurement</code> with the given
arguments.</p>
<h2>Plotting Results During Acquisition</h2>
<p>So far, the only thing we have done is to print to screen that the
acquisition is happening. However, the results of the measurement are
lost, we don't plot nor save them after the program finishes. Now is the
time when we can exploit the use of a class instead of a simple
function. Remember that the core objective of using classes is to
preserve state, exactly what we want to do. We can improve <code>OhmLaw</code> like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class OhmLaw:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = np.zeros(0)  # To store the data of the measurement
        self.step = 0  # To keep track of the step

    def make_measurement(self, start, stop, num_points, delay):
        x_axis = np.linspace(start, stop, num_points)
        self.data = np.zeros(num_points)
        self.step = 0
        for i in x_axis:
            # Acquire fake data
            self.data[self.step] = np.random.random()
            self.step += 1
            sleep(delay)

        return self.data
</code></pre>
<p>What we have done now is to define attributes of <code>OhmLaw</code> (i.e.,
<code>self.data</code> and <code>self.step</code>) that will keep track of the acquisition.
The data is immediately available after it has been generated, and
therefore we can change how we trigger the measurement, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import threading
ohm = OhmLaw()

t = threading.Thread(target=ohm.make_measurement, args=(0,1,11,1))
t.start()
print('Triggered measurement')
i = ohm.step
while t.is_alive():
    if i != ohm.step:
        print('Latest data value: {}'.format(ohm.data[ohm.step-1]))
        i = ohm.step
</code></pre>
<p>The first few lines are the same, but what we are changing is the
<code>while</code> loop. First, we check if the <code>step</code> we are measuring is
different from the last step we saw. If it is different, then we get the
latest data point. Remember that, since the step is incremented right
after the acquisition, we should retrieve <code>data[ohm.step-1]</code> or we would
be ahead one data point.</p>
<p>As you can see, the <code>while</code> loop doesn't have any kind of delay, as soon
as a new data point is detected, it will be fetched. If you change the
<code>delay</code> for <code>make_measurement</code> you will see that the printing to the
screen is also altered. This may not be exactly the behavior that you
want. In our case, poking the <code>ohm.step</code> is fast, but it may be that you
have to communicate to a device to see if there are new data points and
perhaps you don't want to do that as fast as possible but after a
certain interval. The code would become:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import threading
ohm = OhmLaw()

t = threading.Thread(target=ohm.make_measurement, args=(0,1,11,1))
t.start()
print('Triggered measurement')
i = ohm.step
while t.is_alive():
    if i != ohm.step:
        print('Number of points acquired: {}'.format(ohm.step-1))
        i = ohm.step
    sleep(2)
</code></pre>
<p>As simple as that, now you are checking the <code>ohm.step</code> attribute only
once every two seconds. If you start playing around you will see a lot
of different behaviors. For example, you will notice that you may lose
the last few steps of the measurement if the refresh rate is not fast
enough, etc. All these considerations are natural when you start dealing
with threads and actions happening simultaneously.</p>
<h2>Multiple Threads</h2>
<p>If you are of a curious type, probably you are wondering if you could
start as many threads as you like. In principle the answer is yes, you
are not limited to only one. In fact, when you start a thread, it is
technically the second one running, since the main thread is the one
that holds the code. Imagine that you want to start a second
measurement, you can do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">meas_1 = threading.Thread(target=ohm.make_measurement, args=(0, 1, 11, 1))
meas_1.start()
meas_2 = threading.Thread(target=ohm.make_measurement, args=(0, 1, 20, 1))
meas_2.start()
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the code above, you will have two threads, one called
<code>meas_1</code> and the other <code>meas_2</code>, however they share the same <code>data</code> and
<code>step</code> attribute in the object <code>ohm</code>. Every time a data point is
generated, it will overwrite the value acquired in the other thread. If
you were dealing with a real device, it would become much worse, because
you would be trying to set two different output voltages on the same
device at the same time.</p>
<p>There are different ways around this, the first one is altering the
method <code>make_measurement</code> in order to allow only one execution at a
time. This can be done by checking if an attribute <code>running</code> is set to
<code>True</code> or not. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class OhmLaw:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = np.zeros(0)  # To store the data of the measurement
        self.step = 0  # To keep track of the step
        self.running = False

    def make_measurement(self, start, stop, num_points, delay):
        if self.running:
            raise Exception(&quot;Can't trigger two measurements at the same time&quot;)

        x_axis = np.linspace(start, stop, num_points)
        self.data = np.zeros(num_points)
        self.step = 0
        self.running = True
        for i in x_axis:
            # Acquire fake data
            self.data[self.step] = np.random.random()
            self.step += 1
            sleep(delay)
        self.running = False
        return self.data
</code></pre>
<p>The main changes here are that we set the attribute <code>running</code> to <code>False</code>
when we instantiate the class. Then, when we trigger the
<code>make_measurement</code> method, we check if running is set or not. If it is
set, we raise an error that will prevent the method to be run again. If
it is not set, we continue as always. Check that before entering into
the time-consuming loop, we set <code>self.running</code> to <code>True</code> and we set it
back to <code>Flase</code> when it is finished. Go ahead and try to run twice the
measurement and you won't be allowed.</p>
<p>It may seem a bit far-fetched, but trying to run the measurement twice
is a very common mistake when you have a graphical user interface.
Sometimes you don't realize that a measurement is going on and you try
to start a new one. Now we know how to avoid triggering twice the same
measurement, but there is one big functionality missing: how to stop a
measurement.</p>
<h2>Stopping a Thread</h2>
<p>When you are running a long task, such as acquiring from a device, it
may happen that you need to stop it. For example, you may notice that
something is not right with your data, or you already have sufficient
information to move on and doesn't make sense to wait until the end.
Python doesn't allow you to kill threads, which means that we have to
find a way around it. As you have seen in the examples above, we are
normally exchanging information with the thread through attributes in a
class. This means that we could use the same strategy to stop a thread,
by breaking the loop. The <code>OhmLaw</code> class will look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class OhmLaw:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = np.zeros(0)  # To store the data of the measurement
        self.step = 0  # To keep track of the step
        self.running = False
        self.stop = False

    def make_measurement(self, start, stop, num_points, delay):
        if self.running:
            raise Exception(&quot;Can't trigger two measurements at the same time&quot;)

        x_axis = np.linspace(start, stop, num_points)
        self.data = np.zeros(num_points)
        self.step = 0
        self.stop = False
        self.running = True
        for i in x_axis:
            if self.stop:
                print('Stopping')
                break
            # Acquire fake data
            self.data[self.step] = np.random.random()
            self.step += 1
            sleep(delay)
        self.running = False
        return self.data
</code></pre>
<p>The highlighted lines point to the changes that we have done in order to
stop the loop. Whenever you feel like stopping the acquisition, the only
thing you need to do is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ohm.stop = True
</code></pre>
<p>And as soon as the last point is generated, the loop will exit without
errors. Since you will have access to <code>ohm.step</code> you will know exactly
how many data points were acquired, and those will be available in
<code>ohm.data</code>. At this point, something that should be bugging you is that
we are polluting the <code>OhmLaw</code> class with attributes and considerations
that are inherent to working with threads. If you were to use the class
in a non-threaded application, the <code>self.stop</code>, <code>self.running</code>, etc. are
not useful and are just making the code more complicated.</p>
<h2>Subclassing a Thread</h2>
<p>One of the many advantages of Python's syntax is that it is very easy to
extend the functionality of any module. In this case, we want to expand
how the <code>Thread</code> works, by allowing a direct interaction with the
<code>OhmLaw</code> class. Let's see first how to subclass a <code>Thread</code> in order to
start personalizing it. In the examples above, we have constructed a
thread and we have called the <code>start</code> method. When you subclass a
thread, you don't define a <code>start</code>, but rather a <code>run</code> method. The
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#thread-objects">official
documentation</a>
is quite clear:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from threading import Thread

class Worker(Thread):
    def __init__(self, target, args=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.target = target
        self.args = args

    def run(self):
        self.target(*self.args)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Worker</code> class works exactly the same as a <code>Thread</code>. You can replace
the code to run a measurement like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">meas_1 = Worker(target=ohm.make_measurement, args=(0, 1, 11, 1))
meas_1.start()
</code></pre>
<p>And it will behave in the same way as running a normal <code>Thread</code>.
Remember that the highlighted line is very important in order to inherit
all the functionality from the base class. The main question is why
would you like to have a custom thread instead of using the default.
Imagine that you don't want to raise an error when you trigger a second
measurement, but instead, you want to build a queue of commands to
execute. In that way, you won't find any issues, nor in our simple
example nor when dealing with real devices.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Worker(Thread):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.queue = []
        self.keep_running = True

    def add_to_queue(self, target, args=None):
        print('Adding to queue')
        self.queue.append((target, args))

    def stop_thread(self):
        self.keep_running = False

    def run(self):
        while self.keep_running:
            if self.queue:
                func, args = self.queue.pop(0)
                func(*args)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Worker</code> class has now become a useful tool to run several functions
one after the other. The only thing you need to do is to use the method
<code>add_to_queue</code> with the appropriate arguments. Let's see step by step.
First, we removed the arguments from the <code>__init__</code> because we don't
need them. We created two attributes, <code>keep_running</code> that is going to be
used to stop the execution of the thread. You would use it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">worker = Worker()
worker.start()
worker.add_to_queue(ohm.make_measurement, args=(0, 1, 11, .1))
worker.add_to_queue(ohm.make_measurement, args=(0, 1, 11, .1))
worker.add_to_queue(ohm.make_measurement, args=(0, 1, 11, .1))
while worker.queue:
    print('Queue length: {}'.format(len(worker.queue)))
    sleep(1)
worker.stop_thread()
</code></pre>
<p>We begin by creating the <code>worker</code> and starting a separate thread. This
is the reason why we have to do <code>start()</code> after instantiating it. The
<code>run</code> method is an infinite loop that will look for elements within the
<code>queue</code>. If there is a new element, it will get it and it will execute
it. The <code>pop</code> command is very useful because it retrieves the element in
the first position and deletes that element from the list. As soon as
you add an element to the queue, it will be executed. You could add, for
example, a method for generating data, a method for saving the data,
etc. Remember that if you don't stop the <code>worker</code> with <code>stop_thread()</code>
the program will never finish, because the <code>worker</code> is hanging in an
infinite loop.</p>
<p>You can try different things, for example reimplementing the <code>is_alive</code>
method. There are no real limits to how much you can bend and improve
built-ins by subclassing them. A very useful method to be sure that the
thread has finished running is <code>join</code>. If you use <code>worker.join()</code>, the
program will block there until the thread is effectively finished.</p>
<h2>Using Locks</h2>
<p>The example above is already more complicated than what you normally
need to do in the lab. After all, you are in complete control of your
experiment and therefore you know that you shouldn't trigger two
measurements at the same time. However, there are several tools in
threads that at some point may be useful for you and therefore it makes
sense to know, at least, that they exist. One of such tools is <em>locks</em>.
A lock allows you to prevent the execution of code if another thread is
doing something. Let's see how it works. We start with the simple
version of the <code>worker</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from threading import Thread, Lock

lock = Lock()

class Worker(Thread):
    def __init__(self, target, args=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.target = target
        self.args = args

    def run(self):
        lock.acquire()
        self.target(*self.args)
        lock.release()
</code></pre>
<p>We define a <code>lock</code> outside of the <code>Worker</code>, because it needs to be
shared between different instances. The idea of a lock is that it is
open by default. When you do <code>lock.acquire()</code> you are going to close the
lock. Unless it is already closed, in which case the code will halt in
there waiting until the command <code>lock.release()</code> is executed. We acquire
the lock just before running the function, i.e. when the <code>start()</code> is
executed and we release it right after. If you try to run two
measurements, the second will halt until the first one is finished. The
code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">meas_1 = Worker(target=ohm.make_measurement, args=(0, 1, 11, 1))
meas_1.start()
meas_2 = Worker(target=ohm.make_measurement, args=(0, 1, 11, 1))
meas_2.start()
</code></pre>
<p>Even if not blocking, because everything was delegated to a thread, will
run only one measurement at a time. This is a neat trick that if you
implement correctly can save you a lot of time checking whether a
specific task is already running or not. Remember that a crucial mistake
happens when, for example, an error appears. If the target function
raises an error, the <code>lock.release()</code> line will never be executed and
the subsequent threads will never run.</p>
<h2>Advantages and Limitations of Threads</h2>
<p>Right now, especially if it is your first encounter with threads in
Python, they may look like the solution to all your problems. They are
an amazing tool, relatively easy to implement, there is no argument
against that. One of the main advantages of threads is that the memory
space is shared, and therefore you can use the information stored in the
class <code>OhmLaw</code> in any thread, even the main thread. This allows you to
monitor the progress, update a plot or even alter the execution of a
method while it is running.</p>
<p>However, we never discussed what happens when the tasks running on
threads are computationally expensive. So far, the methods that we have
been running inside threads were spending more time in a <code>sleep</code>
statement than anything else. This is a normal case for slow
experiments, but as soon as you start doing data analysis while you
acquire, or you generate a lot of data, things are going to get more
complicated. Let's first see an easy example. Computing random numbers
is a relatively expensive task (by <em>expensive</em> I mean computationally).
We can define the following function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

def calculate_random(number_points):
    for i in range(10, number_points):
        data = np.random.random(i)
        fft = np.fft.fft(data)
    return fft
</code></pre>
<p>This is an expensive function. We calculate random arrays of variable
size and compute their Fourier transform.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from time import time
t0 = time()
d = calculate_random(5000)
print('Total time: {:2.2f} seconds'.format(time()-t0))
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the code above, most likely you are going to get something in
the order of 10 seconds. Most likely you are working on a multi-core
computer. This means that you have different processors available at the
same time. If you look at the use of them while the above code is
running, you probably will notice that there are only one of the cores
being used at 100%, while the others are quite free.</p>
<p>If you were to run the code more than once, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">d = calculate_random(5000)
d2 = calculate_random(5000)
...
</code></pre>
<p>You will notice that the total time is multiplied by the number of calls
to <code>calculate_random</code>. This is expected because while the first is
running the program is waiting and when it is done, you execute the
other. Let's see what happens if we run the code in two different
threads:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from time import time
from threading import Thread

t0 = time()
t1 = Thread(target=calculate_random, args=(5000,))
t2 = Thread(target=calculate_random, args=(5000,))
t1.start()
t2.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()
print('Total time: {:2.2f} seconds'.format(time()-t0))
</code></pre>
<p>Most likely you will see that even if you are running in two different
threads, the time it takes to run is twice as long and if you monitor
the processors, you will still see that only one is being used. This
happens because Python implemented something called the <strong>Global
Interpreter Lock</strong>, or <strong>GIL</strong>.</p>
<h3>The GIL</h3>
<p>The Global Interpreter Lock is responsible for triggering concurrently
different parts of the code. As we saw earlier, a lock is a tool that
allows you to wait for other processes to finish before you start
something new. In Python, this means that when you are running code,
there is a default daemon that will make sure that no two different
lines are executed at the same time.</p>
<p>Basically what the GIL is doing is similar to what the operating system
does in single-core CPUs. It runs a task for a short time, switches to
another task runs it for a while, switches, etc. On one hand, this
behavior has a computational cost associated with the switching from one
task to another, on the other, it is not equivalent to two tasks running
simultaneously. When the task is not computationally expensive (such as
<code>sleep</code>), you will see an increase in efficiency. However, when you
start with more complex scenarios where you need to analyze data or save
to disk, etc., you may start finding bottlenecks hard to debug and you
will see that your computer is far from crashing.</p>
<p>The GIL is also responsible for preventing the simultaneous access to
the same memory. Imagine that you are updating a value at the same time
that you are deleting it from a different thread. You may face several
corruption problems if you are not very careful about how you implement
your threads.</p>
<p>The main message, therefore, is that <strong>threading</strong> doesn't allow you to
run code in parallel, i.e. in different cores, but it allows you to run
tasks in a non-blocking way. The benefits of using Threads are, for
example, that you can share the memory and that you don't need to be too
careful about how you read or write data into variables. Especially when
dealing with normal experiments, threads are going to be more than
enough to improve the behavior of your programs.</p>
<h2>The Multiprocessing Module</h2>
<p>It would be somewhat naïve to settle with the <em>threading</em> module and
limit ourselves to one core per computer. Python provides another module
called <em>multiprocessing</em>. You can read the details at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html">the official
documentation</a>.
Fortunately, the way to work with this module is very similar to the way
you work with threads. Let's build on the previous example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from multiprocessing import Process

t0 = time()
t1 = Process(target=calculate_random, args=(5000,))
t2 = Process(target=calculate_random, args=(5000,))
t3 = Process(target=calculate_random, args=(5000,))
t1.start()
t2.start()
t3.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()
t3.join()
print('Total time: {:2.2f} seconds'.format(time()-t0))
</code></pre>
<p>When you run the code above, you will see that all the processors in
your computer are engaged. The number of processes that you can spawn is
not limited, but normally you shouldn't see an increase in performance
once you have as many processes as cores on your computer.</p>
<p>Multiprocessing has, however, a limitation that has to be addressed
carefully: the state is not shared. Therefore, each process will have
access to its own resources, but you can't simply exchange them. For
example, in the experiment, if you start the measurement after you have
created the process, the class would have the same value for
<code>self.running</code>, meaning that the second time you want to run it, nothing
will stop you.</p>
<h2>Sharing Information with Queues</h2>
<p>The proper way of exchanging information between processes is to use
Queues. When we developed the worker earlier, we used the word <em>queue</em>
exactly preparing for this topic. A queue holds information that can be
accessed by any thread in a first-in-first-out base. Let's see a simple
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from multiprocessing import Process, Queue


def move_from_in_to_out(q_in, q_out):
    while not q_in.empty():
        data = q_in.get()
        q_out.put(data)


q_in = Queue()
q_out = Queue()

for i in range(1000):
    q_in.put(i)

p = Process(target=move_from_in_to_out, args=(q_in, q_out))
p.start()
p.join()

print('Q_in is empty: {}'.format(q_in.empty()))

while not q_out.empty():
    print(q_out.get())
</code></pre>
<p>First, we define a function that can work with <code>Queues</code>, <code>q_in</code> and
<code>q_out</code>. In the example, we are just grabbing elements from one and
placing them in the other. To grab an element from a queue you use
<code>get()</code> and you use <code>put</code> for the opposite. We populate the <code>q_in</code> with
some initial values and then we start a process. Once it is finished, we
check that the queue is empty and we print all the elements.</p>
<p>There is nothing really fancy about the example, but it is enough for
getting you started. Of course, different processes can access the same
queue. For example, you could add a second process that does the
opposite, moves from <code>q_out</code> to <code>q_in</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">p = Process(target=move_from_in_to_out, args=(q_in, q_out))
p2 = Process(target=move_from_in_to_out, args=(q_out, q_in))
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>p2</code> will not run if <code>q_out</code> is empty, we should populate it
together with <code>q_in</code>. Moreover, we can add a new process to monitor
which one of the other two is winning.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def print_len_queue(q_in, q_out):
    while not q_in.empty() or not q_out.empty():
        space = int(q_in.qsize() / (q_in.qsize() + q_out.qsize()) * 50)
        output = str(q_in.qsize())+ '||' + space * ' '+ '|' + (50-space) * ' ' + '||' + str(q_out.qsize()) + '\r'
        print(output, end=' ')

p3 = Process(target=print_len_queue, args=(q_in, q_out))
</code></pre>
<p>If you start all the processes, what you will see on screen is a
vertical bar that moves to the left or to the right, according to which
queue is getting full. This is just a toy example, but that already
shows how powerful queues are.</p>
<h2>Limitation of Queues</h2>
<p>Before you get too enthusiastic about <em>queues</em>, there is a fundamental
limitation that you may encounter if you work intensively with them,
especially when acquiring large volumes of data. I wanted to use queues
in order to acquire images from a CCD and stream them to the hard drive,
in order to increase the total time that could be acquired before
running out of memory. The idea was having a <em>process</em> that would
continuously fetch images from a camera and put them into a queue. A
second process would fetch them from it and would save them to a file.</p>
<p>However, it is impossible to know how big a queue can be in Python.
Allocating memory is not trivial since the queue can hold any type of
data. If you monitor the memory available, you will notice that the
larges value that you can store varies from execution to execution and
therefore you won't be able to predict exactly when you are running out
of memory. If you find a solution to this problem, please leave a
comment because I am more than intrigued by it.</p>
<p>The only solution that I came up with was to manually limit the amount
of memory that the queue can take up based on previous experiences. Once
a threshold is surpassed, the program would stop acquiring images until
the queue is free. It is not very elegant, but at least it doesn't crash
and therefore the data is saved.</p>
<h2>Threads and Jupyter</h2>
<p>If you are a Jupyter notebook user, you will be very happy to know that
threads are compatible with it. Imagine that you are analyzing a large
dataset, or that you are performing a measurement from within a cell. It
would be ideal to be able to run other cells simultaneously. If you run
either a Thread or a Process in one cell, you will be able to continue
using your notebook without any problems.</p>
<p>This is very handy if, for example, you are running a simulation and you
would like to check the intermediate results. The same steps that we
have done at the beginning, with the simulated acquisition of data, can
be performed from within Jupyter. I won't cover the details in this
article because they deserve a separated entry, but please, play around
and leave your experience in <a href="https://github.com/PFTL/pftl_discussions">the
forum</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Being able to run code in non-blocking ways is fundamental in many
applications, not only in the lab but also when you are analyzing or
simulating data. When you are running tasks that are not computationally
expensive but that take longer to complete, you can easily implement
threads. In this article, we have covered some of the strategies that
you can implement in order to be able to stop the execution of a thread
and how to define your custom workers.</p>
<p>When you are trying to increase the efficiency of a computationally
expensive program, <em>threading</em> is not going to help you because of the
Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). You should, therefore, use the
<em>multiprocessing</em> module, which implements a very similar API to the
<em>threading</em> module. This makes your code easy to adapt. The main
limitation is that the memory between different processes is not shared,
and therefore you need to implement extra strategies in order to
exchange data. We have covered Queues, but they are not the only ones.</p>
<p>When the complexity of your program increases, you should always check
whether the modules you are using are <strong>thread-safe</strong> or not. Many
developers take into account this factor and develop code that can be
run also within threads. However, many developers may not have taken
into account that their module could be used in this context and
therefore you should test it yourself.</p>
<p>Threading is a very exciting way of programming and is compatible also
with older Python versions. I find the Threading and the Multiprocessing
syntax very clear and very handy for running tasks such as the ones that
appear when controlling a setup or analyzing data. Since Python 3.4
there is a new library called
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">Async</a> that allows
running code asynchronously. It looks like the future for this kind of
programming, but I found the syntax much harder to understand in order
to propose solutions.</p>
