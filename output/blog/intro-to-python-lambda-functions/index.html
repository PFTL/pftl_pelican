              <p>Some time ago, Python introduced in its syntax the possibility to define
functions using <code>lambda</code> instead of <code>def</code>. These functions are called
anonymous and are very common in other languages such as Javascript.
However, in Python, they seem a bit obscure and are often either
overlooked or misused. In this article, we are going to introduce the
lambda functions and discuss where and how to use it.</p>
<p>To define a function, you can use the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def average(x, y):
    return (x+y)/2
</code></pre>
<p>Then, if you would like to calculate the average of two numbers, you can
simply do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">avg = average(2, 5)
</code></pre>
<p>In such case, <code>avg</code> would have a value of <code>3.5</code>. We could also define
<code>average</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">average = lambda x, y: (x+y)/2
</code></pre>
<p>If you test this function, you will see that the output is exactly the
same. It is important to point out that the syntax is very different
between <code>def</code> and <code>lambda</code>. First, we define the arguments <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
without any parenthesis. Then, we define the operation that we want to
apply. Note that the <code>return</code> is implicit when you use a lambda
function.</p>
<p>There are, however, more fundamental differences. Lambda functions must
be expressed on only one line, and they have no docstring. If you try
<code>help(average)</code> on each definition above, you will see that the output
is very different. Moreover, there is no way of documenting what the
second version of <code>average</code> is actually doing.</p>
<p>Functionally speaking, both ways of defining <code>average</code> give the same
result. So far, the difference between them is very subtle. The main
advantage of <em>lambda</em> (or anonymous) functions is that they don't need a
name. Moreover, assigning a name like what we did above is considered
bad practice, as we will discuss later on. Let's now see in what context
you would like to use a lambda function instead of a normal function.</p>
<p>Most tutorials focus on lambda functions for sorting a list. We can do
the same before going to other topics. Imagine that you have the
following list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">var = [1, 5, -2, 3, -7, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine you would like to sort the values, you can do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">sorted_var = sorted(var)
# [-7, -2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
<p>That is easy enough. But what would happen if you would like to sort the
values based on the distance to a given number? You need to apply a
function to each number, such as <code>abs(x-1)</code> if you are computing the
distance to 1, and sort the values based on the output. Fortunately
<code>sorted</code> allows you to do that using the keyword argument <code>key=</code>. We
could do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def distance(x):
    return abs(x-1)

sorted_var = sorted(var, key=distance)
# [1, 3, -2, 4, 5, -7]
</code></pre>
<p>Another option would be to use a lambda function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">sorted_var = sorted(var, key=lambda x: abs(x-1))
</code></pre>
<p>Both examples are going to produce the exact same output. There is no
functional difference between defining a function using <code>def</code> or using
<code>lambda</code>. I can argue that the second example is slightly shorter than
the first one. Also, it makes the code more readable, since you can
immediately see what are you doing to each element (<code>abs(x-1)</code>) instead
of digging through your code to see where <code>distance</code> was defined.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to use it in combination with <code>map</code>. Map is a way
of applying a function to every element on a list. For example, based on
the example above, we can do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">list(map(distance, var))
# [0, 4, 3, 2, 8, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>Or, using the lambda expressions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">list(map(lambda x: abs(x-1), var))
# [0, 4, 3, 2, 8, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>Which gives the exact same output and, again, one can argue which one is
easier to read. The examples above are what you may see in other
tutorials. Probably is what you will see if you go through
StackOverflow. One of the possibilities is to use lambda functions in
combination with Pandas.</p>
<h2>Pandas and Lambda Functions</h2>
<p>The example data was inspired by
<a href="https://data36.com/pandas-tutorial-1-basics-reading-data-files-dataframes-data-selection/">this</a>
example and can be found
<a href="https://github.com/PFTL/website/blob/master/example_code/30_lambdas/example_data.csv">here</a>.
Create a file <strong>example_data.csv</strong> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csv">animal,uniq_id,water_need
elephant,1001,500
elephant,1002,600
elephant,1003,550
tiger,1004,300
tiger,1005,320
tiger,1006,330
tiger,1007,290
tiger,1008,310
zebra,1009,200
zebra,1010,220
zebra,1011,240
zebra,1012,230
zebra,1013,220
zebra,1014,100
zebra,1015,80
lion,1016,420
lion,1017,600
lion,1018,500
lion,1019,390
kangaroo,1020,410
kangaroo,1021,430
kangaroo,1022,410
</code></pre>
<p>To read the data as a DataFrame, we can simply do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('example_data.csv', delimiter = ',')
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine you would like to capitalize the first letter of each animal's
name on the data frame, you can do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">df['animal'] = df['animal'].apply(lambda x: x.capitalize())
print(df.head())
</code></pre>
<p>And you will see the results. Of course, lambda functions can become
much more complex. You can apply them to an entire series instead of
single values, you can combine them with other libraries such as numpy
or scipy and perform complex transformations to your data.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of lambda functions is that if you are
using Jupyter notebooks, you can see the changes right away. You don't
need to open another file, run a different, cell, etc. If you go to the
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.22/generated/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html">Pandas
documentation</a>
you will see that lambdas are used quite often.</p>
<h2>Qt Slots</h2>
<p>Another common example of using lambdas is in combination with the Qt
library. We have written an <a href="../../blog/step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-gui">introductory article on
Qt</a> in the past. Feel free to
browse through it if you are not familiar with how building user
interfaces work. A very minimal example, that just shows a button, it
looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QPushButton

app = QApplication([])

button = QPushButton('Press Me')
button.show()

app.exit(app.exec())
</code></pre>
<p>If you would like to trigger an action when pressing the button, that
action has to be defined as a function. If we want to print something to
screen when the button gets pressed, we can simply add the following
line right before <code>app.exit</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">button.clicked.connect(lambda x: print('Pressed!'))
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the program again, every time you press the button you will
see the <code>Pressed!</code> appearing on the screen. Again, using lambda
functions as slots for signals can speed up your coding and make your
programs easier to read. However, lambda functions also need to be
considered with caution.</p>
<h2>Where to use lambda functions</h2>
<p>Lambda functions can only have 1 line. This forces developers to use
them only in contexts where the behavior can be achieved without a
complex syntax. In the examples above, you can see that the lambda
functions are very simple. If it would have required to open a socket,
exchange some information, process the received data, etc. probably it
wouldn't have been possible to do it on a single line.</p>
<p>The natural scenario where lambda functions can be used is as arguments
for other functions that require callables as arguments. For example,
the <code>apply</code> of a Pandas Data Frame requires a function as an argument.
Connecting signals in Qt also requires a function. If the function that
we are going to apply or execute is simple, and we are not going to
re-use it, writing it as an anonymous function may be a very convenient
way.</p>
<h2>Where not to use lambda functions</h2>
<p>Lambda functions are anonymous, therefore, if you are assigning a name
to them, such as when we did:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">average = lambda x, y: (x+y)/2
</code></pre>
<p>It means there is something you are doing wrong. If you need to assign a
name to the function, so you can use it in different places of your
program, use the standard <code>def</code> syntax. There is a lengthy discussion on
the abuse of lambda functions in Python <a href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/09/stop-writing-lambda-expressions/">on this
blog</a>.
The one that I have seen quite often, especially by people who have just
learned about lambdas, is this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">sorted_var = sorted(var, key=lambda x: abs(x))
</code></pre>
<p>This innocent example may be hard to wrap around if it's the first time
that you see lambda functions. But what you have is that you are
wrapping a function (<code>abs</code>) within another function. It would be like
doing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def func(x):
    return abs(x)
</code></pre>
<p>What is the advantage compared to just doing <code>abs(x)</code>? Indeed, no
advantage, this means that we can also sort a list like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">sorted_var = sorted(var, key=abs)
</code></pre>
<p>If you pay attention to the example that we've developed earlier, we
used <code>abs(x-1)</code> exactly to avoid this redundancy.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Lambda (or anonymous) functions are a tool that is slowly getting more
popular in Python programs. That is why it is very important that you
can understand what it means. You have to remember that there is nothing
that the lambda syntax allows you to do that it wouldn't be possible to
do without them. It is more a matter of convenience, syntax economy, and
perhaps readability.</p>
<p>In other programming languages, such as JavaScript, anonymous functions
are used very often and have a much richer syntax than in Python. I
don't believe Python will head the same way, but in any case, they are a
tool that can help you not only with your current programs but they can
also help you understand what is going on if you ever tinker with other
languages.</p>
