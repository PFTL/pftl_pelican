              <p>One of the most common devices in a lab is a National Instruments
acquisition card, also called a DAQ. As you probably know by now, the
default programming environment for such cards is Lab View, but what you
may not be aware is that there are libraries for interfacing with other
languages. NI provides a common driver to all of their devices called
<em>NI-DAQmx</em> and how to use their hardware through the C programming
language is <a href="http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370471AA-01/">well
documented</a>.</p>
<p>Once there is good documentation for one programming language, there are
no limits for developers to expand the toolbox into other languages. For
National Instruments devices, there is a project called
<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/PyDAQmx/">PyDAQmx</a> that ported all the
functions to be Python compatible. Since it is a port of the C code,
what you should always bear in mind is that you have to check the
<a href="http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370471AA-01/">National Instruments
documentation</a> and
adapt the code to Python.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Since the writing of this article, a new Python package supporting
NI-DAQmx was released by National Instruments itself. You can see the
<a href="https://nidaqmx-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation here</a>.
I didn't have time to test it yet, but looks very promising. Keep an eye
on the <a href="https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python/issues">bugs and issues</a>
because they may be a good source of information.</p>
</div>
<p>Let's see how to get started. Remember that each card has different
specifications and therefore some of the options may not be present in
your current configuration. Let's assume we want to read an analog input
from our device; you need to know the number that was assigned to your
card in order to communicate with it; normally you should have National
Instruments software that allows you to configure the number of your
card.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import PyDAQmx as nidaq


t = nidaq.Task()
t.CreateAIVoltageChan(&quot;Dev1/ai0&quot;, None, nidaq.DAQmx_Val_Diff, 0, 10, nidaq.DAQmx_Val_Volts, None)
t.CfgSampClkTiming(&quot;&quot;, 1000, nidaq.DAQmx_Val_Rising, nidaq.DAQmx_Val_FiniteSamps, 5000)
t.StartTask()
</code></pre>
<p>In these few lines of code we have created a new Task and called it <code>t</code>;
we have defined an analog input channel for <code>Dev1</code> and port number
<code>ai0</code>. We also configured the timing to be internal, with 1000 samples
per second and in total, we want to acquire 5000 samples. We finally
trigger the task to start acquiring samples. It is interesting to
compare our code to what is documented, so you can learn how to adapt
the code to Python.</p>
<p>We first go to the documentation of the method
<a href="http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370471AA-01/daqmxcfunc/daqmxcreateaivoltagechan/">CreateAIVoltageChan</a>
and the first thing you should notice is that the name is actually
different; it is <strong>DAQmxCreateAIVoltageChan</strong>. The first thing to note
is that the <em>DAQmx</em> prefix is dropped in PyDAQmx. Then we can see the
arguments that the function takes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int32 DAQmxCreateAIVoltageChan (
   TaskHandle taskHandle,
   const char physicalChannel[],
   const char nameToAssignToChannel[],
   int32 terminalConfig,
   float64 minVal,
   float64 maxVal,
   int32 units,
   const char customScaleName[]);
</code></pre>
<p>Since we are using the task as Python object, we drop the first argument
of the function; PyDAQmx takes care of it (notice that we are using the
syntax <code>t.CreateAIVoltageChan</code>. Then we have to pass all the other
arguments, paying attention to their types. So, where it says <code>char</code> we
should pass a <code>String</code>; that is what we do for the channel. In this
example, we don't assign a name to the channel and therefore we leave it
as <code>None</code>. Next, we have to define the <code>terminalConfig</code>; if you look at
the documentation, you will see that there are different options, for
example <code>DAQmx_Val_RSE</code>, <code>DAQmx_Val_Diff</code>, etc. PyDAQmx has all these
configurations already defined and we can use them directly as in the
example above: <code>nidaq.DAQmx_Val_Diff</code>.</p>
<p>Then it asks for the limits of our analog input; remember that the DAQmx
works with units that can be different from volts and that will be
defined later on; the limits that we establish here are in those
specific units. Setting the limits allows the DAQ card to automatically
set a gain to our measurement, therefore increasing the effective
resolution of the measurement. The values are automatically converted to
the requested type, provided that they are numbers.</p>
<p>When performing a measurement with an NI Card we have to explicitly set
its units; it may very well be that you have a thermocouple connected to
the analog input and therefore you want to measure Kelvins instead of
Volts, or that you have any other transducer plugged. Defining custom
scales is an entire chapter and therefore it is much easier to leave
them here as volts and do the transformation directly in our code. We
use again a built-in option of DAQmx, the <code>nidaq.DAQmx_Val_Volts</code> and
the last option is left to <code>None</code> because it is what the documentation
asks for in case we set the scale to Volts.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Converting variable types from Python to C or the other way around is
handled in different ways by different libraries. PyDAQmx is doing all
the work under to hood and that is why we can use an integer instead of
a float, for example. But be aware that it will not always be the same;
some libraries require to define very specific types.</p>
</div>
<p>The other method,
<a href="http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370471AA-01/daqmxcfunc/daqmxcfgsampclktiming/">CfgSampClkTiming</a>
is used for configuring the clock used to acquire the samples. I leave
it up to you to check the documentation and to understand what each
argument of the function is doing. In short, I set it to use an internal
clock at a rate of 1000 samples per second for a total of 5000 samples
(i.e. 5 seconds total acquisition time). The last line simply triggers
the task.</p>
<p>The next step is to read the data that was acquired. Remember that it
takes 5 seconds for the acquisition to complete; the DAQmx functions are
non-blocking, meaning that the execution of your program will not halt
at each execution. For reading from the card we will use another method
defined within the Task object; you will also need to use numpy for this
example to work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

[...]

data = np.zeros((5000,), dtype=np.float64)
read = nidaq.int32()
t.ReadAnalogF64(5000, 5, nidaq.DAQmx_Val_GroupByChannel,
   data, len(data), nidaq.byref(read), None)
</code></pre>
<p>Reading from the NI DAQ has a structure more similar to how proper C
code looks like and is quite different from how Python code works. The
first thing to note is that there is no return; we are not doing
anything like <code>data = t.ReadAnalogF64()</code>. Let's see it step by step. The
<a href="http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370471AA-01/daqmxcfunc/daqmxreadanalogf64/">documentation</a>
is useful but doesn't explain how the actual syntax works. Again, we
skip the first argument, the <code>task handler</code> because we are using the
object-oriented-style.</p>
<p>We define how many data points <em>per channel</em> we want to read; if we were
acquiring more than one channel, it is important to notice that it is
not the total number of points. We set the timeout in seconds, in order
for the function to stop waiting in case there are not enough data
points available. Then we set how to group the values in case we are
reading from more than one channel. Remember that each channel is read
sequentially, so it would be Chan1_1 -&gt; Chan2_1 -&gt; Chan3_1
-&gt; Chan1_2 -&gt; Chan2_2 -&gt; Chan3_2 -&gt; Chan1_3 -&gt; etc.
If we group them by channel, they will be returned as all the
measurements from Chan1, all the measurements from Chan2, etc. I prefer
it this way because it works well with numpy's reshape.</p>
<p>Now, the interesting part; we pass as an argument <code>data</code>, which was
defined few lines before as an empty numpy array. In the documentation,
it is defined as The array to read samples into. This is a very common
way of working with functions in C; we first create the memory structure
that will hold the output of the function, in this case, a numpy array
with 5000 elements. Whatever is present in the array will be overwritten
by the read function. The next argument is the
actual number of samples read from each channel; in other words, the
length of the data array.</p>
<p>The final argument is the <code>read</code> integer, that was also defined few
lines before. It will hold the total number of data points read per
channel. Note that we are not simply passing the read integer as an
argument to the function, but we are using a method called <code>byref</code>. This
is typical when working with external libraries written in C. It
basically means that you are passing the reference to an object and not
the object itself; you are letting the function know where in the memory
is located that specific variable. In the end, the effect is the same:
the variable will hold the information you need.</p>
<p>Now you can plot your <code>data</code>, save it or do whatever you like with it.
The read function has a lot of options that I haven't fully covered, but
that you can easily check the documentation. The complexity arises
because the function covers a lot of different scenarios with few
inputs. For example, when you are continuously acquiring and you wish to
download as many data points as there are available but you cannot know
beforehand how many. It can also take care when you use an external
trigger and you don't know how long it will take to complete an
acquisition.</p>
<p>Even though National Instruments cards were not designed to be used with
Python, there can still be used in a variety of projects without many
complications. The use of a common API for all the cards makes them
ideal because exchanging them doesn't require a single change in the
code. However, each card can have very different capabilities, for
example, the acquisition rate or the number of simultaneous tasks that
it can handle.</p>
