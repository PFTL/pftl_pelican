              <p>If you have developed code for long enough, probably you have faced the
situation in which a task takes longer to complete and in the meantime,
your program can't perform any other task. Most likely you can't even
politely cancel what the program is doing, you will have to resort to
the Ctrl+C strategy. Fortunately, Python has different approaches to
overcome these issues.</p>
<p>In this introduction, we are going to cover how you can use Threads to
develop a more flexible program. We have already discussed about
<a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/implementing-threads-for-measurements">threads</a>, and we have used
them when <a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-gui">developing a user
interface</a>. In this article, we
are going to organize the information available for you to learn how to
be creative with threads in your own programs.</p>
<h2>What are not Threads</h2>
<p>If you are a native English speaker, the word <em>thread</em> may bring to mind
a clear picture, which is not always the case if English is your second
language. Think about a sweater, it is made out of many threads that run
up and down, left and right, all intertwined. In a computer program, a
thread looks the same, is a logical path that runs from start to end,
but it doesn't need to be unique.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that threads which belong to the same
process in Python do not run exactly at the same time. A processor with
a single core can perform one computation at a time. However, even
before the multi-core processors appeared, it was possible to have
several programs open and running. It is also possible to type a new
address in your browser while a website is loading, etc.</p>
<p>The idea of threads is that each one can be executed in short pieces,
and the computer has the freedom to switch, very quickly, between them.
For a short time, it is checking your spelling, for a short time, it
renders a website, for a short time it writes to the hard drive, etc.
This is what gives programs a smooth feeling, and it is exactly what we
did to <a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-gui">avoid the window freezing</a>
when dealing with Qt.</p>
<p>However, when the computation in one of the threads is very complex,
there won't be enough time to switch from one to the other. Downloading
data, waiting for user input, writing to the hard drive, those are not
computationally expensive tasks, and that is why you can run several of
those threads simultaneously. Rendering an image, for example in a
videogame, requires millions of complex calculations. Thus, threads
won't help you achieve a smoother program if one of the tasks you need
to run is computationally very expensive.</p>
<p>This will become clearer when we start developing complex examples and
we explore the limitations and advantages of each approach we decide to
take.</p>
<h2>A Simple Thread</h2>
<p>When dealing with threads, the best is to start with a very simple
example. Let's create a function that takes longer to execute, but which
is not computationally very expensive. For example something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from time import sleep

def print_numbers(number, delay=1):
    for i in range(number):
        print(i)
        sleep(delay)
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the function, for example by doing <code>print_numbers(10)</code>, you
will see that the program takes 10 seconds to run and in the meantime,
your program is not able to do anything else. To be more strict, our
program has only one thread in which the function is executed.</p>
<p>One possible approach would be to run the function on a separate thread.
The syntax would be as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from threading import Thread

t = Thread(target=print_numbers, args=(10,))
t.start()
print('Thread started')
</code></pre>
<p>To create a thread we specify which function is going to run in it. Pay
attention to the lack of <code>()</code> when defining the target. We want to pass
the function itself, and not the result of the function to the thread.
To specify arguments, we can pass a tuple (or any iterable). If you run
the program, you will see an output like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">0
Thread started
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</code></pre>
<p>Can you explain what is going on? You see first the 0, which gets
printed because of the line <code>t.start()</code>, then the print statement is
executed, but the rest of the <code>print_numbers</code> appears later. With this
approach, there is a lot that you can experiment with. Last syntax topic
to cover, if you want to pass a keyword argument (like the <code>delay</code>), you
can simply do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">t = Thread(target=print_numbers, args=(10,), kwargs={'delay': .2})
t.start()
print('Thread started')
</code></pre>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Perhaps you will see that not always the <code>Thread Started</code> message
appears after the <code>0</code>. That happens because in the example above you
have no control at all on the order in which commands will be executed.
If the operating system is busier, the result may slightly change, etc.
The starting of a thread may happen slightly later than the following
line on the main thread.</p>
</div>
<p>The last basic behavior you need to be aware of is on how to wait until
the thread finishes. Perhaps you want to be sure a thread is finished
before you try to do something with its results, or you want to be sure
you can safely close the program, etc. This can be achieved with the
<code>join</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">t = Thread(target=print_numbers, args=(10,), kwargs={'delay': .2})
t.start()
print('Thread started')
t.join()
print('Thread finished')
</code></pre>
<p>You will see that the message <code>Thread finished</code> will always be printed
after the execution of the function is done. Now you have the basic flow
for working with multiple threads. Remember that there is always going
to be a <em>main thread</em>, which is the one that you create when running the
script, and from this one others are created.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not limited to starting only one thread, we can create
several. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">t1 = Thread(target=print_numbers, args=(10,), kwargs={'delay':.5})
t2 = Thread(target=print_numbers, args=(5,))
t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()
</code></pre>
<p>If you look at the output you will see that numbers are being printed at
the same time from both threads. Starting threads as t1, t2 is not the
most elegant solution, but for the time being it proves its point.</p>
<h2>Shared Memory</h2>
<p>One of the most important topics when working with threads is that of
shared memory. Most likely you have realized that when you develop a
program, you define variables, functions, etc. However, variables
defined in another program are not accessible. Each program has access
to a determined memory space. Threads share the same memory space and
thus can modify each other's data.</p>
<p>Let's start by showing how you can modify the elements of a numpy array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

def increase_by_one(array):
    array += 1

data = np.ones((100,1))
increase_by_one(data)

print(data[0])
</code></pre>
<p>What you see in the code above is that the function <code>increase_by_one</code>
takes one argument and increases its value by one. If the argument is a
numpy array, it will increase the value of each element by one. What is
important to note, is that the function is not returning any value. This
can be done because arrays are mutable. You can check the article about
<a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/mutable-and-immutable-objects">mutable and immutable data
types</a> in case you are
curious.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the fact that if instead of an array, you use a number
as your data, the effect won't be the same. Let's see how we can use the
example above with threads:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">t = Thread(target=increase_by_one, args=(data,))
t.start()
t.join()
print(data[0])
</code></pre>
<p>What you see in the code above is very subtle, but very important also.
Data was defined on the main thread and is passed as an argument to the
thread. Inside the thread, the data gets modified, but that is happening
to the data on the main thread. This basically means that the data on
the main thread and the data on the child thread is actually the same.</p>
<p>This behavior is very important because it is what allows you to quickly
get information out of a thread. If the function <code>increase_by_one</code> would
have returned a value, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def increase_by_one(array):
    new_arr = array + 1
    return new_array
</code></pre>
<p>There wouldn't have been a way of just getting the information out of
the child thread. Therefore, for working with threading you will also
need to design your code in such a way that allows you to achieve what
you want.</p>
<p>Of course, the data can be shared between more threads. For example, we
can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from threading import Thread
import numpy as np


def increase_by_one(array):
    for i in range(10000):
        array += 1


def square(array):
    for i in range(10000):
        array /= 1.1


data = np.ones((100,1))

t = Thread(target=increase_by_one, args=(data,))
t2 = Thread(target=square, args=(data,))
t.start()
t2.start()
t.join()
t2.join()
print(data[0])
print(np.mean(data))
</code></pre>
<p>You see that in the example above, we defined two different functions,
one that increases the value in the array by 1 and the other which
divides it by 1.1. Each function performs the operation 10000 times. If
you run the code, you will see that at the end, the value of the first
element of the array and the mean value are being printed.</p>
<p>Go ahead and run the program more than once. Do you get always the same
result? Most likely you don't. If you get the same result, increase the
number of times each operation is performed from 10000 until you see the
effect. You can also try lowering from 10000 and at some point, you will
see that the result is always the same.</p>
<p>Are you able to explain what is going on?</p>
<p>In the previous example, at the beginning of the article, there was
always a sleep statement. Sleep blocks the program execution, but the
processor is not doing anything. That gives plenty of opportunities for
other tasks to run. Remember that the switching from one thread to the
other is handled by the operating system.</p>
<p>In the examples of this section, both functions are computationally
expensive. Even if they are silly examples, they don't give a break to
the processor (there is no sleep). Increasing the value of all the
elements of an array 10000 times takes a while to run, the same is true
for dividing by a value. However, what happens, is that at some point
the operating system decides to halt one thread and run the other. The
exact moment at which this happens is not under your control, but the
operating system's.</p>
<p>Since the switch from one task to the other happens at apparently random
moments, the result you get is not the same. Remember that first adding
and then dividing is not the same than first dividing and then adding.
Having shared memory can be great, but you also have to be careful when
you are expecting a special result. For example, you may end up dividing
by zero only if a particular set of events happens in a special order.
It may very well be that when you test your program it works, but once
in a while, it will crash.</p>
<h2>A More Extreme Example</h2>
<p>Numpy is a highly optimized library that takes care of a lot of things
for you. In the examples above, every time we increase or divide the
values in an array, even if we don't see it, there is a loop under the
hood going through each individual element. One of the things numpy
takes care for us is that the loop never gets interrupted. It won't
happen that some elements are first increased and then divided, and some
elements are the opposite.</p>
<p>However, we can force this behavior, to make very apparent what happens
when working with threads on changing elements on shared memory. First,
we can change the functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def increase_by_one(array):
    for i in range(len(array)):
        array[i] += 1

def divide(array):
    for i in range(len(array)):
        array[i] /= 1.1
</code></pre>
<p>Compared to what we did before, this is a highly inefficient way of
achieving the same result, but it is useful to prove our point. Now, if
you run it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">data = np.ones((100000,1))

t = Thread(target=increase_by_one, args=(data,))
t2 = Thread(target=divide, args=(data,))
t.start()
t2.start()
t.join()
t2.join()
print(np.max(data))
print(np.min(data))
</code></pre>
<p>You will see that the maximum value and the minimum value in your array
may not be the same. This means that for some elements the order of the
operation was reversed. Now you start seeing that threading has its
subtleties. The main problem is that since it is hard to anticipate the
exact flow, the outcome of the same program may change with each
execution.</p>
<p>Debugging multi-threaded programs which are badly design is an
incredibly tough task.</p>
<h2>Synchronizing Threads with Locks</h2>
<p>In the example above, we saw that when running multiple threads, the
operating system has control on the order in which each is run. If we
run the code more than once, we could end up with different results. To
synchronize different threads, we can make use of <code>Locks</code>. A lock is a
special object which can be <code>acquired</code> and <code>released</code>.</p>
<p>When you try to acquire a lock, the program will wait until the lock is
released. This means that the lock can't be acquired more than once at
the same time. A lock allows you to explicitly wait until something
finishes running before something else runs. Let's see a very simple
implementation based on the example above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from threading import Lock

lock = Lock()

def increase_by_one(array):
    lock.acquire()
    for i in range(len(array)):
        array[i] += 1
    lock.release()


def divide(array):
    lock.acquire()
    for i in range(len(array)):
        array[i] /= 1.1
    lock.release()
</code></pre>
<p>The lock is created at the beginning. Now, you see that each function
starts by acquiring the lock. If it was already acquired, it will wait
there until it is released. This means that the for-loop which increases
each element by one or which divides each element needs to finish before
the other will be able to run.</p>
<p>By using <a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/the-with-command-and-custom-classes">context managers</a> the
syntax can become much simpler:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def increase_by_one(array):
    with lock:
        for i in range(len(array)):
            array[i] += 1

def divide(array):
    with lock:
        for i in range(len(array)):
            array[i] /= 1.1
</code></pre>
<p>There is a final detail that is worth mentioning. We could acquire the
lock in the main thread to prevent the execution of the two functions
until a certain moment. We could do something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">lock.acquire()
data = np.ones((100000,1))
t = Thread(target=increase_by_one, args=(data,))
t2 = Thread(target=divide, args=(data,))
t2.start()
t.start()
print('Threads are still not running')
data += 10
lock.release()
t.join()
t2.join()
print(np.max(data))
print(np.min(data))
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the lock is acquired from the main thread. This means that
the other threads will be waiting until the lock is released to run, and
only one will run at a time. However, it is important to point out that
which thread runs first depends on the implementation of the operating
system.</p>
<h2>Synchronizing Threads: RLocks</h2>
<p>Locks can be very useful when you want to ensure that a certain block of
code will run completely before something else alters the data on which
you are working. There is, however, a caveat. The functions we defined
above, <code>increase_by_one</code> and <code>divide</code> both acquire a lock. Imagine that
we would like to execute one of those functions on the main code, and
prevent the other threads from running, we can try something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">lock.acquire()
data = np.ones((100000,1))
t = Thread(target=increase_by_one, args=(data,))
t2 = Thread(target=divide, args=(data,))
t2.start()
t.start()
increase_by_one(data)
lock.release()
</code></pre>
<p>If you try to run the code, it will simply hang. Depending on your level
of experience with threading, it may be very hard to realize where the
problem is. A common approach would be to add print statements at key
positions to understand what runs and where it stops.</p>
<p>In the example above, we start by acquiring the <code>lock</code>. This will
prevent the threads from changing the data. However, when we explicitly
call <code>increase_by_one</code>, it will also want to acquire the <code>lock</code>. This
makes the program wait in that line indefinitely for the lock to be
released, but it won't happen.</p>
<p>Another object that may be very helpful in this scenario is the <code>RLock</code>,
or reentrant lock. The syntax will be very similar, we just need to do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from threading import RLock

lock = RLock()

[...]
</code></pre>
<p>I've removed the repeated code for brevity. If you try again, you will
see that the program runs as expected. Reentrant locks are thread-aware,
this means that they block the execution, only if you try to acquire
them from a different thread, not from the same one. Since we acquired
the lock on the main thread, when we run the <code>increase_by_one</code>, it will
not be blocked on the lock line.</p>
<p>Re-entrant locks are a great tool when you may have functions that are
executed from different threads and you know it is safe to run them
within the same lock. You have to be very careful with the design of
your program to create code with an expected behavior. Sometimes RLocks
can be changed to Locks if the code is designed in a different way (or
vice versa), and you will have to decide what is healthier for the long
term.</p>
<h2>Timeouts</h2>
<p>A very common scenario when working with threads is that something
happens unexpectedly, either it happens before than expected, or an
exception is raised, or there is simply a bug in your code. In any case,
you will likely end up with threads which are blocked from running. And
thus, some resources may not be released in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>To avoid these dead ends, we can implement timeouts for most blocking
operations. Let's see how to use a timeout for a <code>Lock</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def increase_by_one(array):
    l = lock.acquire(timeout=1)
    print('Lock: ', l)
    for i in range(len(array)):
        array[i] += 1

data = np.ones((100000,1))

t = Thread(target=increase_by_one, args=(data,))
lock.acquire()
t.start()
print('Before Sleeping')
sleep(5)
print('After sleeping')
t.join()
print(data[0])
print(np.mean(data))
</code></pre>
<p>The code above is very similar to what we have been doing in the
previous examples. However, pay attention to the fact that we eliminated
the context manager from the <code>increase_by_one</code> function, to make it
explicit. We've also added two print statements to show at which stage
the program is being delayed. If you run the code above, you should see
the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Before Sleeping
Lock:  False
After sleeping
[2.]
2.0
</code></pre>
<p>Now you see, that even if the lock is acquired by the main thread (and
never released), the thread which holds the <code>increase_by_one</code> function
is executed correctly. You can alter the code to see what are the
different possibilities. It is important to note that the value for <code>l</code>
within the function is <code>False</code>. This allows you to monitor whether the
lock has timed out or not and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Timeouts also work for <code>join</code>. You have to be aware, though, that when
timeouts happen, you may be in a situation that you were not intending.
For example, if you are waiting for a lock and it times out, it means
that the intended state may not be met. In the examples above, it would
mean that we may try to increase and divide at the same time, without
being able to guarantee what happens first.</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>Together with <code>Locks</code>, <code>Events</code> can be used to synchronize the behavior
of threads. Locks are useful because they can be acquired only once at a
time. However, this may not be what you need. Events, as the name
suggests, allow you to signal a specific condition which may be used by
several threads which were waiting for that event. Let's see a very
simple example, in which we run two threads to increase by one a value,
but we are waiting for the array to be populated before.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from threading import Thread, Event
import numpy as np

evnt = Event()

def increase_by_one(array):
    print('Waiting for event')
    l = evnt.wait()
    print('Increasing by one')
    for i in range(len(array)):
        array[i] += 1

data = np.zeros((100000,1))

t = Thread(target=increase_by_one, args=(data,))
t2 = Thread(target=increase_by_one, args=(data,))
t.start()
t2.start()
for i in range(len(data)):
    data[i] += 1
print('Data Ready. Setting event')
evnt.set()
t.join()
t2.join()
print(data[0])
print(np.mean(data))
</code></pre>
<p>What you see above, is that both threads are ready to run, but they will
wait until the event is set. By the way, the <code>wait</code> command also accepts
a timeout argument. Then we prepare our data, by setting each element to
one. Once we are ready, we set the event which allows the threads to
stop waiting and start working.</p>
<p>A very common scenario for this patter would be if you are waiting for a
connection to become available. Imagine you are communicating with a
database, you would like to run the threads once the communication is
established and not before. Resources which may take longer or shorter
to become available are clear indicators for using an <code>Event</code> object.</p>
<h3>Stopping Threads with Events</h3>
<p>So far, we have always let the program run until its completion,
including the threads. However, a very common scenario is to have a
thread which will run forever, processing any data that comes its way.
For example, you may have a thread which continuously analysis the
content of tweets. At some point, you may want to stop the thread
without creating a keyboard interrupt. Events are ideal tools for this.
Let's see it with an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from threading import Thread, Event
from time import sleep

import numpy as np

event = Event()

def increase_by_one(array):
    print('Starting to increase by one')
    while True:
        if event.is_set():
            break
        for i in range(len(array)):
            array[i] += 1
        sleep(0.1)
    print('Finishing')

data = np.ones((10000, 1))
t = Thread(target=increase_by_one, args=(data,))
t.start()
print('Going to sleep')
sleep(1)
print('Finished sleeping')
event.set()
t.join()
print(data[0])
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, based on what we have been always doing in this
tutorial, you see that there is a check within the loop. If the event is
set, then the loop will end. While the event is not set, the loop will
keep running forever. If we run the code, you will see that the thread
starts increasing by one, we wait for one second and we set the event to
break the loop.</p>
<p>Since it takes at least 0.1 seconds to run each loop (there is a sleep),
and we wait 1 second to set the event, you can see that the final value
in the array is 10. You can experiment with different options, for
example, what happens if you remove the sleep in the function, do you
get much higher values? That gives you an idea of how fast your code is
running.</p>
<p>Of course, you are not limited to stopping only one thread with an
event. You can use the same event in several threads. You are also not
constrained to set the event from the main thread. You can signal events
from threads, etc. We are going to see this in the following article,
where we will explore applications of threads.</p>
<p>If you try to stop a threaded application by pressing Ctrl+C (or
Ctrl+Break if you are on Windows), you will notice that the thread which
is stopped is normally the main thread, but the other threads keep
running. When you start having several threads running at the same time,
it is important to start including into your design how you will handle
the finalization of your program, both intentionally and not
intentionally.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this article, we have seen the basics of working with threads. We
have seen how you can start multiple threads and how to synchronize
them. You have to remember that threads are not running simultaneously,
and therefore you can't run your code faster, but it gives you a lot of
flexibility when there are tasks that are slow and not computationally
expensive.</p>
<p>The examples that we have seen in this tutorial are almost trivial and
most are based on performing highly inefficient tasks, such as
increasing the values in an array one by one. If you want to continue
learning about threads, you can head to the following tutorial on <a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/handling-and-sharing-data-between-threads">how
