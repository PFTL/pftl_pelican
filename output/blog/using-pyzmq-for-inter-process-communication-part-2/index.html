            <main>
              <p>In this article, we are going to cover how you can leverage the
possibilities of ZMQ to exchange data between different processes in
Python. We have covered the <a href="http://localhost:8000/blog/using-pyzmq-for-inter-process-communication-part-1">basics of pyZMQ</a>
in part 1. This is a fairly advanced tutorial, in which we are not only
going to use pyZMQ, but also the multiprocessing library,
<a href="{filename}02_HDF5_python.rst.md">HDF5</a>, and
<a href="http://localhost:8000/blog/step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-gui">openCV</a>. We are going to acquire
images from the webcam as fast as possible, we are going to save the
data to disk during the acquisition, and we are going to perform some
basic analysis.</p>
<p>The idea of this article is to put together several of the topics
covered in the past. If you find that some of the contents are
confusing, I strongly suggest you check the other articles to clarify
the topics. We are going to develop one main Python script with some
extra files that will allow us to keep everything organized. To specify
file names, I will use <strong>bold</strong>. The code, as always, <a href="https://github.com/PFTL/website/tree/master/example_code/26_ZMQ">can be found on
Github</a>.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>What we want to achieve is a program that acquires images from a camera
and at the same time it saves them to the hard drive and is able to
perform basic analysis on the frames. We want everything to happen
simultaneously, even if the frames are being acquired faster than what
we can save to the disk. We would also like to have the flexibility of
turning on and off the saving or the analysis without having to change a
lot the code base.</p>
<p>Since we are going to run everything as a single-script (with some
package imports), the best idea is to use the <a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/using-pyzmq-for-inter-process-communication-part-1/#id9">publisher/subscriber
pattern</a>.
We will have a central publisher which will be able to broadcast every
frame that is acquired, and subscribers which will get the frames and
perform special operations on them.</p>
<h2>Camera Control</h2>
<p>We are going to use almost <a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-gui/">the same
code</a>
that we developed when we saw how to build a user interface for a camera
with PyQt5. We will wrap OpenCV in a custom class that will allow us to
quickly acquire movies, frames, etc. Therefore, in a file called
<strong>camera.py</strong>, let's put the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import cv2


class Camera:
    def __init__(self, cam_num):
        self.cam_num = cam_num
        self.cap = None
        self.frame_shape = []

    def initialize(self):
        self.cap = cv2.VideoCapture(self.cam_num)

    def get_frame(self):
        ret, frame = self.cap.read()
        return frame

    def acquire_movie(self, num_frames):
        movie = []
        for _ in range(num_frames):
            movie.append(self.get_frame())
        return movie

    def close_camera(self):
        self.cap.release()
</code></pre>
<p>This is a very simple class, that can be used like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">cam = Camera(0)
cam.initialize()
frame = cam.get_frame()
movie = cam.acquire_movie(20)
cam.close_camera()
</code></pre>
<p>The code is simple enough to get started very quickly. But you can
already see that there are some drawbacks. The first is that when we
want to acquire a movie the code blocks. If we would like to do anything
else in the program, we won't be able. The fastest way to overcome this
limitation is to use <a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/implementing-threads-for-measurements/">threads or
processes</a>.</p>
<h3>Multi-Threading</h3>
<p>Remember that the core idea of a thread is that it still runs on the
same core, and therefore it just gives time for other tasks to use the
same resources. If you have an operation that takes a lot of computing
power, different threads will not speed up the program. On the other
hand, different processes can be spawned across different cores, and
therefore you can use the full computing power of your PC. However,
there are other things that have to be taken into account when choosing
threads or processes.</p>
<p>Threads are running inside the same process and their memory space is
shared. This is the approach we followed in the <a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-gui/">PyQt
tutorial</a>.
For example, we could change the <code>Camera</code> class in order to run the
movie acquisition inside a thread while retaining control on when to
stop the acquisition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def acquire_movie(self):
    movie = []
    self.stop_movie = False
    while not self.stop_movie:
        movie.append(self.get_frame())
    return movie
</code></pre>
<p>And we would use it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from time import sleep
from threading import Thread

cam = Camera(0)
cam.initialize()
movie_thread = Thread(target=cam.acquire_movie)
movie_thread.start()
sleep(10)
cam.stop_movie = True
cam.close_camera()
</code></pre>
<p>We created a new thread called <code>movie_thread</code> in which the loop for
acquiring a movie will run. After starting it, we wait 10 seconds and we
change the attribute <code>stop_movie</code> in order to stop the loop. You can see
that from one thread we are able to change the value of an attribute
which is being used in another thread. This approach is very
straightforward, and also allows us to get the data out, instead of
simply using <code>movie</code>, we can use <code>self.movie</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def acquire_movie(self):
    self.movie = []
    self.stop_movie = False
    while not self.stop_movie:
        self.movie.append(self.get_frame())
</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to the fact that we are not returning any value since we
don't need that anymore. The data is available as an attribute of the
class itself. After acquiring 10 seconds, we have access to the frames
by simply doing the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(cam.movie)
</code></pre>
<p>This also opens the door to monitor the progress, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from time import sleep, time
from threading import Thread

cam = Camera(0)
cam.initialize()
movie_thread = Thread(target=cam.acquire_movie)
movie_thread.start()
t0 = time()
while time()-t0&lt;10:
    print(f'Total frames: {len(cam.movie)}')
    sleep(0.5)
cam.stop_movie = True
cam.close_camera()
</code></pre>
<p>So now you can see that while the movie is being acquired, you can
monitor how many frames are available. This looks already very good, is
you can forgive the <code>append</code> which is a bottleneck for this kind of
applications.</p>
<h3>Multi-Processing</h3>
<p>Threads work, but what about Processes? The syntax is extremely similar:
we should just replace <code>Thread</code> for <code>Process</code>. However, we would face
several issues if we try to do this. Because the memory is not shared
between different processes, we will not be able to stop the acquisition
by changing an attribute to a class. We will see later that this is not
an issue because there are proper multiprocessing tools to achieve this
behavior. On the other hand, we wouldn't be able to monitor the number
of frames acquired because <code>cam.movie</code> wouldn't be accessible from the
main process. But we could still find ways around this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is not all. The biggest drawback of
<code>multiprocessing</code> is that the way Windows and Linux start new processes
is very different. In Linux, when you do
<code>Process(target=cam.acquire_movie)</code>, the process is going to receive a
copy of the <code>cam</code> object, including the attributes that you generated
when instantiating, etc. On the other hand, on Windows, the process will
receive a fresh python interpreter, and therefore the <code>cam</code> class would
not be instantiated.</p>
<p>If you are <strong>on Linux</strong>, the following works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from time import sleep, time
from multiprocessing import Process

cam = Camera(0)
cam.initialize()
movie_process = Process(target=cam.acquire_movie)
movie_process.start()
t0 = time()
while time()-t0&lt;10:
    # print(f'Total frames: {len(cam.movie)}')
    sleep(0.5)
movie_process.terminate()
cam.close_camera()
</code></pre>
<p>The acquisition will be running on a different thread, which we force to
finish after 10 seconds. If you are on Windows, however, you will get a
very cryptic exception that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>It took me an extremely long time to debug a program that I had
developed on Linux and that was crashing on Windows because of no
apparent reason. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html">Python
documentation</a>
has some insights, but understanding what is actually written and its
consequences are not trivial.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
</div>
<p>If you plan to use the multiprocessing library with programs that should
run both on Windows and on Linux you have to be aware of the differences
and learn how to structure your code.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that we will not be able to run multi-processing
programs on Windows, it just means that we have to structure our code
carefully in order to make it cross-platform. For this particular
application, we will keep the camera acquisition in the main processes,
using threads, and thus it will be compatible with Windows out of the
box. We will use the multiprocessing library for the next section.</p>
<h2>Publisher</h2>
<p>Now we know how to acquire a movie, but we still need to do something
with the data other than simply accumulating it on a variable until the
movie is over. Since we want to attach different tasks to the frames, we
will use the <a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/using-pyzmq-for-inter-process-communication-part-1/#publisher-subscriber">Publisher/Subscriber
pattern</a>
available through <strong>pyZMQ</strong>. We will start by developing the publisher
which will broadcast every frame.</p>
<p>Here, some decisions have to be made. One is how we plan to make the
information available to the publisher. An approach that works very
nicely in multi-processing applications is to have a queue object. The
publisher will consume this queue and will broadcast the information.
For our application, this means that the camera class will append each
frame to a specific queue, and the publisher will use it. Let's start by
creating a new file called <strong>publisher.py</strong> with the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"> import zmq
 from time import sleep}
def publisher(queue, event, port):
    port_pub = port
    context = zmq.Context()
    with context.socket(zmq.PUB) as socket:
        socket.bind(&quot;tcp://*:%s&quot; % port_pub)
        while not event.is_set():
            while not queue.empty():
                data = queue.get()  # Should be a dictionary {'topic': topic, 'data': data}
                socket.send_string(data['topic'], zmq.SNDMORE)
                socket.send_pyobj(data['data'])
        sleep(0.005)  # Sleeps 5 milliseconds to be polite with the CPU
        socket.send_string('stop')
        sleep(1)  # Gives enough time to the subscribers to update their status
</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to the fact that we have chosen to develop a function
instead of a class. This is the choice you have to make in order to make
your code compatible with Windows. Since functions do not store state,
it doesn't matter the method for starting processes employed, it only
matters which arguments are used.</p>
<p>The main block of code is two nested <code>while</code> loops. You can see that
innermost one iterates over every element in the queue. It assumes that
they will all be dictionaries including a <code>topic</code> and some kind of
<code>data</code>. Remember that when you use the PUB/SUB pattern, you can specify
which topics are consumed by which subscribers.</p>
<p>The outer <code>while</code> loop uses the <code>event</code>, which is a multiprocessing
<code>Event</code> object. In the camera example above we used an attribute to stop
a loop. However, if we want to use a separate Process, we can't follow
the same approach. An
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/threading.html#threading.Event">Event</a>
is an object that handles a flag: it is either set to true or not. It is
very useful for synchronizing different processes, or as in this case,
to stop the execution of a loop. The event can be shared safely between
threads and processes, and therefore can be set or cleared anywhere in
our program.</p>
<p>Now we will need to change the <code>Camera</code> class in order to put the movie
frames to a queue. The fastest way of achieving this would be to modify
the <code>acquire_movie</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def acquire_movie(self, queue):
    self.stop_movie = False
    while not self.stop_movie:
        queue.put({'topic': 'frame', 'data':self.get_frame()})
</code></pre>
<p>We can now run the code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from multiprocessing import Queue, Process, Event
from time import sleep, time

from camera import Camera
from publisher import publisher

from threading import Thread

cam = Camera(0)
cam.initialize()

pub_queue = Queue()
stop_event = Event()
publisher_process = Process(target=publisher, args=(pub_queue, stop_event, 5555))
publisher_process.start()
camera_thread = Thread(target=cam.acquire_movie, args=(pub_queue,))
camera_thread.start()
t0 = time()
while time()-t0&lt;5:
    print('Still acquiring')
    sleep(1)
cam.stop_movie = True
stop_event.set()
publisher_process.join()
print('Bye')
</code></pre>
<p>The code, I believe, is self-explanatory if you look at it carefully. We
initialize the camera, create the queue where the frames are going to be
located, create a process for the publisher to run on its own and we
start it. The arguments that the publisher takes, are the queue from
which to fetch frames, the stop event, and the port. We also start the
camera movie acquisition on a separated thread and give as an argument
the same queue that the publisher uses. This allows us to share
information between different processes.</p>
<p>Remember that when you have a queue, every time you do <code>queue.get()</code>,
the element you are fetching is being destroyed from the queue. This
means that if you want to share the same information between more
threads or processes, you would either make more queues or find a better
solution, as we will do later.</p>
<p>In the program above, note that we stop the camera with
<code>cam.stop_movie = True</code>, but we need to use <code>stop_event.set()</code> to do the
same with the publisher. This is a manifestation of the difference
between threads and processes and their possibility to share memory. The
statement <code>publisher_process.join()</code> will wait there until the process
finishes. This is a good way of being sure that we gave enough time to
the publisher to finish with what it was doing before our program stops.</p>
<p>When you work with multiprocessing (or multi-threading) you have to be
careful with how you end things. If your program crashes, it may happen
that you generated orphan processes that keep running in the background
even if your main program exited. You can find these processes by
inspecting the tasks running on your computer. If this ever happens,
close them by hand, because they will keep occupying the same resources
such as the socket port or the file that we will use for saving data.</p>
<p>So far we are not doing anything, the publisher is broadcasting data,
but there is no one to do anything with it. It is time to add our first
subscriber.</p>
<h2>Analyse Data: Subscriber 1</h2>
<p>Imagine that you want to analyze the frames while you are acquiring a
movie. We are going to do a very silly analysis of computing the
maximum, minimum, and average value of the pixels present. Since we
already have the publisher, we can create a subscriber to consume the
data being broadcast. Since analyzing data can be computationally
expensive, it is important to be able to run such tasks in different
processes, and therefore, we will need to make subscribers also
multi-processing compatible. In a new file called <strong>subscribers.py</strong>, we
can put the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
import zmq

def analyze_frames(port, topic, event):
    context = zmq.Context()
    with context.socket(zmq.SUB) as socket:
        socket.connect(f&quot;tcp://localhost:{port}&quot;)
        topic_filter = topic.encode('utf-8')
        socket.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, topic_filter)
        socket.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, ''.encode('utf-8'))
        i = 0
        min = []
        max = []
        avg = []
        while True:
            topic = socket.recv_string()
            data = socket.recv_pyobj()  # flags=0, copy=True, track=False)
            if isinstance(data, str):
                break
            data = np.sum(data, 2)
            min.append(np.min(data))
            max.append(np.max(data))
            avg.append(np.mean(data))
            i+=1
    np.save('summary', np.array([min, max, avg]))
    print(f'Analysed {i} frames')
</code></pre>
<p>This code is also very simple to understand. It is similar to how the
publisher works, but instead of a queue, we determine which topic this
subscriber is going to be listening to. In this case we use a
<code>while True</code> loop, because the <code>recv_string()</code> and <code>recv_pyobk()</code>
methods are blocking. This means that if the publisher is not sending
anything, even if we set the <code>Event</code>, it will not be used by the
subscriber.</p>
<p>We choose the option of the publisher broadcasting a string in order to
force the subscribers to finish. If you are developing larger programs,
you have to be very systematic in order to force all the processes to
gracefully finish and not forgetting any running in the background when
your program stops. The main loop is very clear, we just calculate the
three values and append them to a list. When the subscriber finishes, we
save the data to a file.</p>
<p>Let's update our main script in order to use this subscriber:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from multiprocessing import Queue, Process, Event
from time import sleep, time

from camera import Camera
from publisher import publisher
from subscribers import analyze_frames
from threading import Thread

cam = Camera(0)
cam.initialize()

pub_queue = Queue()
stop_event = Event()
publisher_process = Process(target=publisher, args=(pub_queue, stop_event, 5555))
publisher_process.start()
analyzer_process = Process(target=analyze_frames, args=(5555, 'frame', stop_event))
analyzer_process.start()
sleep(2)
camera_thread = Thread(target=cam.acquire_movie, args=(pub_queue,))
camera_thread.start()
t0 = time()
while time()-t0&lt;5:
    print('Still acquiring')
    sleep(1)
cam.stop_movie = True
pub_queue.put({'topic': 'frame', 'data': 'stop'})
camera_thread.join()
analyzer_process.join()
stop_event.set()
publisher_process.join()
print('Bye')
</code></pre>
<p>There are a few things to pay attention here. One is that we have added
a <code>sleep(2)</code> after starting the analyzer process. This is to give enough
time for the sockets to initialize before starting the measurement.
There could be better ways of doing this, but let's not waste time with
some premature optimization. Since we are working with 3 things
happening simultaneously, i.e. the camera acquisition, the publisher and
the analyzer, we have to be very careful about how we handle each step.</p>
<p>After 5 seconds, the first thing we do is to stop the movie, as always,
with <code>stop_movie = True</code>. Then we add to the queue of the publisher data
which is a string and will force the subscriber to finish when it gets
it. We wait for the camera thread to really finish, and then we wait for
the analyzer process to finish. Only after that, we stop the publisher.
The reason for this is that in the publisher loop you could escape the
loop before reading all the data from the queue.</p>
<p>If you develop this kind of applications long enough, you will start
realizing how important it is to be systematic in your approach to
handle processes and threads and you will start developing your own
standards for finishing subscribers, etc.</p>
<p>So far so good. You can see that there should be a new file created,
with information about the frames that you have acquired. Explore it to
see that everything is there as expected. You can block the camera while
you acquire a movie and see that the average drops, for example.</p>
<h2>Save Data: Subscriber 2</h2>
<p>What we have up to now could be easily achieved with a queue. The camera
acquires frames, puts it in a queue and the queue is consumed by another
process which analyses it. However, if we would like to add another
process which, for example, saves the data while it is being generated,
we would need to create another queue and refactor the camera class,
etc. Moreover, if we would like to sometimes analyze, sometimes save and
sometimes both (or none), we would need to add a lot of verifications to
our code, making it very hard to reuse.</p>
<p>Now, since we have the publisher available, adding a second process to
save the data while we acquire it is very straightforward. We are going
to use <a href="https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/how-to-use-hdf5-files-in-python/">HDF5
files</a>
because they are very versatile for this kind of applications, but you
are free to adapt the code to whatever fits your needs. We can add the
following to the <strong>subscribers.py</strong> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import h5py
from time import sleep

def save_movie(port, topic, frame_shape, dtype):
    f = h5py.File('movie.hdf5', 'w')
    dset = f.create_dataset(&quot;default&quot;, frame_shape+(1,), maxshape=frame_shape+(None,), dtype=dtype)
    context = zmq.Context()
    with context.socket(zmq.SUB) as socket:
        socket.connect(f&quot;tcp://localhost:{port}&quot;)
        topic_filter = topic.encode('utf-8')
        socket.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, topic_filter)
        socket.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, ''.encode('utf-8'))
        i = 0
        while True:
            topic = socket.recv_string()
            data = socket.recv_pyobj()  # flags=0, copy=True, track=False)
            if isinstance(data, str):
                break
            dset[:,:,:,i] = data
            i += 1
            dset.resize(frame_shape+(i+1,))
        sleep(1)  # Gives enough time for the publishers to finish sending data before closing the socket
    f.flush()
    print(f'Acquired {i} frames')
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we need to port and topic, as we will always do for a subscriber.
However, we are going to need to frame shape and type of data in order
to create the HDF5 dataset. Pay attention to two things: first, we are
creating the file with the <code>w</code> option, meaning that we are going to
overwrite anything pre-existent. This is not a good approach for a real
application, but it is up to you to find what is best in your own case.
Second, we create a dataset with an extra dimension (because it is a
movie) and with the <code>maxshape</code> option set to <code>None</code> in the time
dimension. This will allow us to acquire movies for as long as we need.</p>
<p>This is not the most efficient way of handling the task, we could
pre-allocate memory, save in chunks, compress the data, etc. But it
works fine. Since we are saving a movie, we will have 4-dimensional
data: 2 for space, 1 for color (R, G, B) and 1 for time. With h5py this
can be handled immediately, while other approaches such as what Pandas
does may be more convoluted.</p>
<p>The rest of the function is more or less self-explanatory. To run the
program with this added subscriber, we should only add a new process.
For brevity, I will skip the majority of the code, but I hope you can
understand where the following statements go:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">frame = cam.get_frame()
saver_process = Process(target=save_movie, args=(5555, 'frame', frame.shape, frame.dtype))
saver_process.start()
[...]
saver_process.join()
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the program again, you will see that there is a new file
appearing on your hard drive called <strong>movie.hdf</strong>. Since writing to the
hard drive is handled by the operating system, you will see that it may
lag behind compared to the acquisition. This means that the saving can
finish much later than your real acquisition. The <code>save_movie</code> includes
a <code>flush</code> statement at the end, that guarantees that everything is going
to be written before the function ends.</p>
<p>Now you see that if we want to attach a new process to our program, we
can do it without any complications. The main script only requires a
couple of lines and the behavior of the program is greatly enhanced. In
the same way, if we want to switch on or of different tasks, we can do
it without fundamentally altering the basic code.</p>
<h2>ZMQ and Queues</h2>
<p>With the example above you may be wondering what would happen if one of
the subscribers is slower than the rate at which we are generating data.
If you go to the chapter on <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/php:chapter5">Advanced Pub/Sub
patterns</a> you will see that ZMQ
has a very strong opinion about how it should be handled. In a nutshell:
let the subscriber crash. In principle, every subscriber will build up
its own queue in case it lags behind. The reasoning behind this is that
subscribers are likely to be running in a different computer and if it
crashes, the core of the application is still intact.</p>
<p>This approach is, however, not useful for applications running in only
one PC, in which running out of memory will cause also the core
application to crash. Because of the architecture of ZMQ, it is not
possible to monitor the length of the queue in the subscriber.
Therefore, you have to be very careful about how to structure your
program in order to be sure that you will not be accumulating data
beyond the capacity of your computer.</p>
<p>ZMQ implements a parameter called High Water Level (HWL) which instructs
both publishers and subscribers when to start dropping information. To
set the HWL on the publisher, you would add the following line before
the <code>bind</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">socket.setsockopt(zmq.SNDHWM, 5)
</code></pre>
<p>This means that if the publisher accumulates more than 5 frames on its
own queue, it will begin dropping the frames (i.e. not sending them). By
default, ZMQ has a value of 1000 frames which may be too high for
images. The disadvantage, however, is that there is no way of knowing
when (and how many) frames are being dropped.</p>
<p>One of the options would be to implement a solution on the subscriber
side. For example, if frames would be numbered, the subscriber could
verify that each frame is the previous +1 and that it is not skipping
any. This works fine for patterns with only one publisher per
subscriber, and where topics are well defined beforehand. Another
possibility would be to monitor how long it takes for the subscriber to
process data, and abort its execution if it is longer than a predefined
value. This is called the <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/py:suisnail">suicidal
snail</a> and you can find some
examples and discussion on the ZMQ documentation.</p>
<p>As you see, it is not a trivial task. If monitoring the length of the
queue that is being built up is important in your application, you will
need to find solutions that include a broker, such as
<a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> but which I believe is not the
proper solution for stand-alone desktop apps.</p>
<h2>Serializing Python Objects</h2>
<p>I find the solution outlined in the previous sections very elegant. With
a bit of cleaning up, it can work as a generalized signal/slot type of
pattern, multi-processing compatible and even able to distribute tasks
over the network. However, there is something that is important to keep
an eye on, especially if you are generating a high volume of data:
serializing and deserializing python objects.</p>
<p>PyZMQ comes with two methods that are very handy: <code>send_pyobj</code> and
<code>recv_pyobj</code>. Under the hood, pyZMQ is using Pickle to serialize the
objects on one end and deserialize it on the other. Moreover, when we
are storing information on the <code>Queue</code>, python is already serializing
the object. Therefore, in our pattern we are serializing the frame to
put in the <code>queue</code>, deserializing at the <code>publisher</code>, serializing to
broadcast, and deserializing at the <code>subscriber</code>. This operation has a
high penalty and can be greatly improved by carefully planning the code.</p>
<h2>Zero-Copy Messages</h2>
<p>In the examples above, the objects that we are passing around are numpy
arrays. This means that there is another improvement possible: using
<a href="https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/serialization.html">the
zero-copy</a>
possibilities of ZMQ. Both subscribers use the exact same information
and neither of them does any in-place substitution. However, each frame
appears in several places: the camera, the queue, the publisher and the
two subscribers. In reality, we only need the data itself, we don't need
to be passing it from one place to another.</p>
<p>Moreover, since each acquired frame will have the same properties as the
previous one (same shape, same type, etc.), it is possible to write very
efficient code. Using buffers goes beyond the scope of this article, but
I plan on writing a tutorial on them sometime soon. For the time being,
this is the example that appears on the pyZMQ docs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy

def send_array(socket, A, flags=0, copy=True, track=False):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;send a numpy array with metadata&quot;&quot;&quot;
    md = dict(
        dtype = str(A.dtype),
        shape = A.shape,
    )
    socket.send_json(md, flags|zmq.SNDMORE)
    return socket.send(A, flags, copy=copy, track=track)

def recv_array(socket, flags=0, copy=True, track=False):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;recv a numpy array&quot;&quot;&quot;
    md = socket.recv_json(flags=flags)
    msg = socket.recv(flags=flags, copy=copy, track=track)
    buf = buffer(msg)
    A = numpy.frombuffer(buf, dtype=md['dtype'])
    return A.reshape(md['shape'])
</code></pre>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we have seen how to use pyZMQ in a real application
that shares data across different processes. In this specific case, the
processes live on the same computer, but nothing limits us from finding
solutions where the data is shared across the network and handled by
different computers. The main objective of the tutorial was to show you
how you can build programs that are very flexible.</p>
<p>We have seen that if you develop a proper base, choosing a ZMQ pattern
like pub/sub you can quickly switch on/off subscribers that deal with
the information available. We haven't discussed it, but it is also
possible for subscribers to send data to the publisher to be consumed by
downstream processes. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>However, ZMQ is a fairly complex tool and therefore reading
its documentation &lt;http://zeromq.org/&gt; is very important. There
are a wealth of patterns that can be implemented to make the program
more robust, faster, etc. Remember that premature optimization may be a
liability more than a feature.</p>
