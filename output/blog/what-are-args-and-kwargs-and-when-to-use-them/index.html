            <main>
              <p>If you have worked with Python for long enough, probably you have
encountered code that uses <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code> as arguments in
functions. Even if you haven't, it is a very neat feature that allows
you to achieve great flexibility while developing code. In this article,
we are going to discuss what and how to use flexible arguments in
functions.</p>
<h2>Args</h2>
<p>Let's quickly see how <code>*args</code> work in a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_function(*args):
    print(type(args))
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)

test_function('a', 'b', 1, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Which will output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
a
b
1
2
</code></pre>
<p>What you are seeing is that <code>test_function</code> can take any number of
arguments. When you use the <code>*</code> in front of a variable, it will convert
any number of inputs into a tuple. You can access each argument
according to its index. For example, you could get the first value by
doing <code>args[0]</code>, etc. Remember that when you develop functions, it is
the order of the inputs that matter.</p>
<p>It is also possible to mix explicit arguments with <code>*args</code>, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_function(first, second, *args):
    print(first)
    print(second)
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)
</code></pre>
<p>The main difference here is that <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> are mandatory.
This two options would work fine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">test_function('first', 2, 'a', 'b', 'c')
test_function('first', 2)
</code></pre>
<p>while this one would throw an exception:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">test_function('first')
[...]
TypeError: test_function() missing 1 required positional argument: 'second'
</code></pre>
<p>So far, it is clear that you can use <code>*args</code> to accept a variable number
of arguments in a function. But the other path is also possible. Imagine
you have a tuple and you would like to use it as arguments for a
function. For example, let's assume we have a function like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def fixed_args(first, second):
    print(first)
    print(second)
</code></pre>
<p>We can use the function like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">vars = ('First', 'Second')
fixed_args(*vars)
</code></pre>
<p>Which is very convenient in a lot of different situations, especially
when you may have so many inputs that it wouldn't be practical to try to
do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">fixed_args(vars[0], vars[1])
</code></pre>
<p>It is important to note here that Python doesn't force you to use
<code>*args</code> in its syntax as an argument for a function. You are free to
choose whatever variable name you would like. However, <code>*args</code> is a
convention that almost every developer follows. Using it will make your
code much more readable and understandable by others and your future
self.</p>
<p>The action of transforming a tuple (or a list) to different inputs of a
function is called unpacking. But we are not limited to tuples and
lists. We can go one step further and use a generator, such as <code>range</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_function(first, second):
    print(first)
    print(second)

a = range(1, 3)
test_function(*a)
</code></pre>
<p>Working with generators is a different topic, that I will cover in
another tutorial, but for the time being, it is important to note that
the <code>*</code> can have a great impact when used in combination with the
arguments of functions.</p>
<h2>Kwargs</h2>
<p>The idea of <code>kwargs</code> is very similar to that of <code>args</code>, but instead of a
tuple or a list, these are keyword-arguments. This means that instead of
the order in which they appear, the importance is in the label that each
variable has. A quick example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_kwargs(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(key, '=&gt;', value)
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>test_kwargs</code> takes a variable number of
keyword-variables. To use it, we can do something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">test_kwargs(first=1, second=2)
</code></pre>
<p>Which outputs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">first =&gt; 1
second =&gt; 2
</code></pre>
<p>If you try to run the function without keywords, it will through an
exception. In the same way that when <code>*args</code> was used as the argument of
a function, the inputs were transformed to a tuple, <code>**kwargs</code> are
transformed to a dictionary. Here, the important detail is the use of
the <code>**</code> instead of the single <code>*</code>. Of course, you can mix required and
variable inputs, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_function(first, **kwargs):
    print(first)
    print('Number kwargs: ', len(kwargs))
</code></pre>
<p>Which will give you the following outputs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; test_function(1)
1
Number kwargs:  0
&gt;&gt;&gt;test_function(1, second=2, third=3)
1
Number kwargs:  2
</code></pre>
<p>In the same way, as we used <code>*args</code> to unpack a tuple, we can unpack a
dictionary. Let's first consider a function with some required
arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_unpack(first, second, third):
    print(first)
    print(second)
    print(third)
</code></pre>
<p>And for unpacking a dictionary, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">vars = {'second': 2,
    'first': 1,
    'third': 3}

test_unpack(**vars)
</code></pre>
<p>Which will give as output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">1
2
3
</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to the fact that we are not defining the variables in any
special order, but the importance is in the keywords used for building
the dictionary. We could have also done:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">vars = (2, 1, 3)
test_unpack(*vars)
</code></pre>
<p>Which would produce the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">2
1
3
</code></pre>
<p>Now you have a broad idea of how the <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> operators work to pack
and unpack arguments in functions. What you have to remember is that the
<code>*</code> can be used to transform a tuple or list to the arguments of a
function in a specific order. On the other hand, the <code>**</code> can be used to
transform a dictionary to keyword arguments of functions, in which the
order is not important but the label is.</p>
<p>On the other hand, functions that accept arguments with either <code>*</code> or
<code>**</code> can have a variable number of arguments. The first works for
arguments in a certain order, while the latter works for
keyword-arguments. After reading the above sections, you can be tempted
to start using <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code> in your functions. However, you have
to be aware of the implications.</p>
<h2>When not to use args and kwargs</h2>
<p>When you expand your programming toolbox, there is a common desire to
use what you have just learned at every possibility that you encounter.
However, you have to be aware of the consequences and advantages of
using <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code> in your code. Let's consider, for example, a
function that calculates the area of a triangle. We could define it like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def area(base, height):
    return base*height/2
</code></pre>
<p>If you look at the code above, you can easily understand what is going
on. If you want to use what you have just learned, we can re-write the
code to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def area(*args):
    return args[0]*args[1]/2
</code></pre>
<p>Both examples can be used in the same way, but I hope you do agree that
the latter is harder to understand. Moreover, the function can be called
with any number of arguments. If you are using a Python IDE such as
Pycharm, VS Code, they show you what arguments a function takes, but if
you have <code>*args</code> you will have no idea what needs to be supplied.</p>
<h2>When to use args and kwargs</h2>
<p>Imagine someone else is using your code. The functions developed earlier
have only two lines and you can quickly read through them. But if you
have developed a much more complex function, how would someone reading
your code understand how many arguments and which ones to supply? The
same objections apply when you use <code>kwargs</code>. Good code is also code that
can be read and quickly understood.</p>
<h3>Decorators</h3>
<p>Keeping in mind that it is impossible to make a comprehensive list of
situations when it is worth using kwargs and args, we can discuss some
examples. The first that comes to mind is when you are dealing with
<a href="http://localhost:8000/blog/how-to-use-decorators-part-2">decorators</a>. To give a
very short summary, a decorator is a function that wraps another one in
order to extend its functionality without changing the core behavior.
Going back to the example of the area, the function</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def area(base, height):
    return base*height/2
</code></pre>
<p>Works for any pair of numbers, also negative ones. Imagine that we would
like to check whether the arguments of the function are non-negative,
but we don't want to change the function itself, we can develop a
decorator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from functools import wraps

def check_positive(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def func_wrapper(*args):
        for arg in args:
            if type(arg) is int or type(arg) is float:
                if arg &lt; 0:
                    raise Exception(&quot;Function {} takes only positive arguments&quot;.format(func.__name__))
            else:
                raise Exception(&quot;Arguments of {} must be numbers&quot;.format(func.__name__))
        return func(*args)

    return func_wrapper
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not familiar with decorators or the code above seems
confusing, I recommend you check <a href="http://localhost:8000/blog/how-to-use-decorators-part-2">this
article</a>. To use this
decorator, we would simply do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@check_positive
def area_positive(base, height):
    return base*height/2

print(area_positive(1, 2))
print(area_positive(-1, 2))
</code></pre>
<p>And now you will see that an exception will be thrown with the second
line using a negative value for the base. If you pay attention, notice
that we have used <code>*args</code> in the decorator. This allows us to use the
same decorator for any function, not only the area. Imagine we would
like to calculate the perimeter of a triangle, we could simply do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@check_positive
def perimeter(side1, side2, side3):
    return side1+side2+side3
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>*args</code> (or <code>**kwargs</code>) are incredibly useful to have a flexible
decorator. If you go to the article linked earlier, you will see that
the first couple of examples always use a fixed number of arguments,
thus making the decorator applicable only to certain cases.</p>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Another very common scenario where <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code> is very handy is
when you are working with classes. In order to expand the functionality
of classes developed by others, a common pattern is to inherit them and
override the methods you would like to change. This is very frequent
when you are dealing with large libraries or frameworks. For example, if
you are developing a <a href="http://localhost:8000/blog/step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-gui">Qt
application</a>, you will find
yourself with code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self, *args):
        super(MainWindow, self).__init__(*args)
</code></pre>
<p>The rest of the code will do the specific parts of your application. The
snippet above shows that we don't need to look at the original code to
see what arguments are passed, etc. They are simply relayed to the
original <code>QMainWindow</code> class when instantiating. Moreover, if there is
code downstream that is already using <code>QMainWindow</code>, we can use
<code>MainWindow</code> as a drop-in replacement, without the need to explicitly
change every time the class is used.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with frameworks such as <strong>Django</strong> and you are
overriding a method such as <code>save</code> (you can see <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/instances/#django.db.models.Model.save">the docs
here</a>),
you can use the following syntax on your own model:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def save(self, **kwargs):
    # Your custom code goes here
    super().save(**kwargs)
</code></pre>
<p>In this way, your code is future proof. Perhaps today you are not using
some of the arguments that <code>save</code> takes, but by taking a flexible number
of them, you know that if tomorrow you decide to start using some, your
program will not break. Pay attention to the fact that we used only
<code>**kwargs</code>. This is a choice to force the use of keyword arguments,
mainly because it is a function with a lot of arguments, each with a
default value, and we may be interested in altering only one of them.</p>
<h2>Flexibility</h2>
<p>Sometimes flexibility in the number of arguments is needed. A classical
example is Python's <code>dict</code>. When you create a dictionary, you can use
the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
</code></pre>
<p>However, the arguments of <code>dict</code> are not fixed. You could have as well
used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">b = dict(first=1, second=2, third=3)
</code></pre>
<p>The fact that dict can take any keyword argument set is an asset. If you
look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#dict">the
documentation</a>,
it explicitly shows you that dict can be called with <code>dict(**kwarg)</code>. If
you look at <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/_modules/django/db/models/base/#Model">Django's
Model</a>,
you will also see that the <code>__init__</code> method takes <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code>.
This is because the framework wanted to have a great degree of
flexibility while instantiating a class. If you look at the code, you
will see that there are a lot of checks and loops in order to prepare
the object based on the available arguments.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Having a variable number of arguments in functions and methods can help
you develop a much more flexible code. However, this normally comes at a
cost in readability. Understanding where it can be useful to use <code>*args</code>
or <code>*kwargs</code> in your functions requires practice and, more importantly,
reading other's code. You may find great examples if you just look
around the libraries you are already using and you wonder how is it
possible that sometimes you use a different number of arguments.</p>
<p>The opposite path, of using the <code>*</code> or <code>**</code> syntax to pass a tuple or a
dictionary as arguments to a function can greatly simplify your code. A
very simple example would be what happens when you import data using
<code>pyyaml</code>, for example. You end up with a dictionary, that perhaps you
would like to directly pass to a function. Unpacking arguments is very
useful, especially when you are not in control of the functions that you
are using.</p>
