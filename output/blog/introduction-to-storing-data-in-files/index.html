              <p>Storing data to reuse it later is a central part in most Python
applications. Whether you are doing a measurement in the lab or
developing a web application, you will need to save information in a
persistent way. For example, you would like to analyze your results
after you have performed an experiment. Or you would like to keep a list
of e-mails of people who registered on your website.</p>
<p>Even if storing data is of utmost importance, every application will
require different strategies. You have to take into account different
factors, such as the volume of data being generated, how
self-descriptive the data is, how are you going to use it later, etc. In
this article, we are going to start exploring different ways of storing
data.</p>
<h2>Plain Text Files with Numpy</h2>
<p>When storing data on the hard drive, a common option is to use plain
text files. Let's start with a simple example, a <code>numpy</code> array of a
given length. We can generate such an array in the following way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

data = np.linspace(0,1,201)
</code></pre>
<p>Which will generate an array of 201 values equally spaced between 0 and
1. This means that the elements will look like <code>0, 0.005, 0.01, ..</code>. If
you want to save the data to a file, numpy allows you to do it very
easily with the <code>savetxt</code> method, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">np.savetxt('A_data.dat', data)
</code></pre>
<p>Go ahead and open the file <strong>a_data.dat</strong> with any text editor. You
will see that you have a column of all the values in your array. This is
very handy because the file can be read with any other program that
supports reading text files. So far, this example is very simplistic
because it stores only one array. Imagine that you want to store two
arrays, like the ones needed to make a simple plot. First, let's
generate both arrays:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = np.linspace(0, 1, 201)
y = np.random.random(201)
</code></pre>
<p>You can store them very easily by doing the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">np.savetxt('AA_data.dat', [x, y])
</code></pre>
<p>If you open the file, you will see that instead of having two columns,
the file has only two very long lines. This is normally not a problem,
but it makes your file very hard to read if you open it with a text
editor or with other programs. If you want to save the data as two (or
several) columns, you need to stack them. The code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">data = np.column_stack((x, y))
np.savetxt('AA_data.dat', data)
</code></pre>
<p>Check the file again, you will see that you have the x values on the
column on the left and the y values on the other. A file like this is
easier to read and, as we will see later, allows you to do partial
reads. However, there is something very important missing. If someone
opens the file, there is no information on what each column means. The
easier solution, in this case, is to add a header describing each
column:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">header = &quot;X-Column, Y-Column&quot;
np.savetxt('AB_data.dat', data, header=header)
</code></pre>
<p>Check the file again, you will see a nice header explaining what each
column is. Note that the first character of the line is a <code>#</code>. This is
very standard in order to easily identify which lines belong to the
header and not to the data itself. If you want to add a multi-line
header, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">header = &quot;X-Column, Y-Column\n&quot;
header += &quot;This is a second line&quot;
np.savetxt('AB_data.dat', data, header=header)
</code></pre>
<p>The important element to note in the code above is the <code>\n</code> added at the
end of the first line. This is the new line character, which is
equivalent to pressing <code>enter</code> in your keyboard when typing a document.
This character tells Python to go to the line below when writing
information to a file.</p>
<h3>Loading Saved Data with Numpy</h3>
<p>Of course, saving to a file is only half what you have to do. The other
half is reading it. Fortunately, this is very easy with numpy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">data = np.loadtxt('AB_data.dat')
x = data[:, 0]
y = data[:, 1]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that it automatically discards the headers. The advantage of using
always the same library (in this case numpy) is that it makes it
incredibly easy to go through the write/read cycle. If you are trying to
read data from a file that was generated with another program and that
uses another character for starting comments, you can very easily adapt
the code above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">data = np.loadtxt('data.dat', comments='@')
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the code will skip all the lines that start with
an <code>@</code> symbol.</p>
<h2>Saving Partial Files with Numpy</h2>
<p>One common situation is to save to file while the data acquisition or
generation is happening. This allows you, for example, to monitor the
progress of an experiment and to have the data safe even if something
goes wrong with your program. The code is very similar to what we have
done earlier, but not exactly the same:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 1, 201)
y = np.random.random(201)

header = &quot;X-Column, Y-Column\n&quot;
header += &quot;This is a second line&quot;
f = open('AD_data.dat', 'wb')
np.savetxt(f, [], header=header)
for i in range(201):
    data = np.column_stack((x[i], y[i]))
    np.savetxt(f, data)

f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing you have to notice is that we are explicitly opening the
file with the command <code>open</code>. The important portion of information here
is the <code>wb</code> that we added at the end. The <code>w</code> stands for <em>writing</em> mode,
i.e. the file will be created if it doesn't exist, and if it already
exists it will be erased and started from scratch. The second letter,
the <code>b</code> is for binary mode, which is needed for letting numpy append
data to a file. In order to generate the header, we first save an empty
list with the header. Within the for-loop, we save every value to the
file, line by line.</p>
<p>With the example above, if you open the file you will see it exactly as
earlier. However, if you add a <code>sleep</code> statement within the for-loop,
and open the file, you will see the partial saves. Remember that not all
operating systems allow you to open the file in two different programs
at the same time. Moreover, not all text editors are able to notice
changes to the file from outside themselves, meaning that you won't see
the changes to the file unless you re-open it.</p>
<h3>Flushing Changes</h3>
<p>If you start saving partial data often, you will notice that, especially
when your program crashes, some of the data points may be missing.
Writing to disk is a step that is handled by the operating system, and
therefore its behavior can be very different depending on which one you
use and how busy the computer is. Python puts the writing instructions
into a queue, which means that the writing itself can be executed much
later in time. If you want to be sure that changes are being written,
especially when you are aware that your program may give rise to
<a href="../../blog/learning-not-to-handle-exceptions">unhandled exceptions</a>, you
can add the <code>flush</code> command. Simply like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">f = open('AD_data.dat', 'wb')
for i in range(201):
    [...]
    f.flush()
</code></pre>
<p>This will guarantee that you are writing to disk every single time.
Python normally relies on the operating system defaults for handling
buffering of writing events. However, when trying to push the limits, it
is very important to regain control and be aware of what the
consequences may be.</p>
<h3>The With Statement</h3>
<p>When working with files, it is important to ensure that you are closing
it when you finish with it. If you don't do it, you may end up with
corrupted data. In the example above, you can see that if an error
appears within the <code>for</code>, the line <code>f.close()</code> will never be executed.
In order to avoid this kind of issues, Python provides the <code>with</code>
statement. You can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('AE_data.dat', 'wb') as f:
    np.savetxt(f, [], header=header)
    for i in range(201):
        data = np.column_stack((x[i], y[i]))
        np.savetxt(f, data)
        f.flush()
        sleep(0.1)
</code></pre>
<p>The first line is the key element here. Instead of doing <code>f=open()</code>, we
use the <code>with</code> statement. The file will be open while we are inside the
block. As soon as the block finishes, the file will be closed, even if
there is an exception within the block. The <code>with</code> allows you to save a
lot of typing since you don't need to handle exceptions nor to close the
file afterward. It may seem like a small gain at the beginning, but the
conscious developer should use it extensively.</p>
<p>The details of the <code>with</code> statement deserve their own article, which is
in the pipeline for the future. For the time being, remember what it
means when you see it.</p>
<h2>Lower-level Writing to Text Files</h2>
<p>Up to here, we have seen how to use numpy to save data because it is a
standard in many applications. However, it may not fit all the
applications. Python has its own method for writing to and reading from,
files. Let's start writing to a file. The pattern is very simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">f = open('BA_data.dat', 'w')
f.write('# This is the header')
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Or with the <code>with</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('BA_data.dat', 'w') as f:
    f.write('# This is the header')
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>open</code> command takes at least one argument, the filename. The second
argument is the mode with which the file is opened. Basically, there are
three: <code>r</code> for reading, not modifying, <code>a</code> for appending or creating the
file if it doesn't exist, <code>w</code> for creating an empty file, even if it
already exists. If no mode is given, <code>r</code> is assumed, and if the file
doesn't exist, a <code>FileNotFound</code> exception will be raised.</p>
<p>Now that we have the header written to the file, we want to write some
data to it. For example, we can try the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = np.linspace(0,1,201)
with open('BB_data.dat', 'w') as f:
    f.write('# This is the header')
    for data in x:
        f.write(data)
</code></pre>
<p>However, you will see an error, <code>TypeError</code>, because you are trying to
write something that is not a string, in this case, a numpy number.
Therefore, first, you have to transform whatever you want to write to a
string. For numbers, it is very easy, you only need to replace one line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">f.write(str(data))
</code></pre>
<p>If you open the file, you will notice something very strange. The header
and all the elements of your array were written to the same line, no
separation whatsoever between them. This is actually expected if you
think about it. Because you are using lower level commands, you have a
much more precise control over what and how you write to a file.</p>
<p>If you remember from the previous section, you can use the <code>\n</code>
character to generate a new line after writing to a file. Your code will
look like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = np.linspace(0,1,201)
with open('BB_data.dat', 'w') as f:
    f.write('# This is the header\n')
    for data in x:
        f.write(str(data)+'\n')
</code></pre>
<p>If you open the file again, you will see that all your data points are
nicely stacked on top of each other. You will also notice that not all
values have the same length. For example, you will find elements such as
<code>0.01</code>, <code>0.005</code>, and <code>0.17500000000000002</code>. The first two make sense,
however, the third one may seem odd. The last digit in that number is
given because of floating-point errors. You can read more about it in
the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html">Oracle
website</a>
(more technical) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Floating-point_numbers">on
Wikipedia</a>
(more general public-oriented).</p>
<h2>Formatting the output</h2>
<p>One of the most important things to consider when writing data to disk
is how to structure it in order to make it easy to read afterward. In
the section above, we have seen that if you don't append a newline
character after every value, they get printed one after the other, on
the same line. This makes your data almost impossible to read back.
Since every number has a different length, you can't break the line into
smaller information blocks, etc.</p>
<p>Formatting the output is therefore very important to give sense to your
data in the long run. Python offers different ways for formatting
strings. I will choose the one I normally employ, but you are free to
explore other alternatives. Let's first adapt the example above, with
<code>format</code>. You can print every value to a different line like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = np.linspace(0,1,201)
with open('BC_data.dat', 'w') as f:
    f.write('# This is the header\n')
    for data in x:
        f.write('{}\n'.format(data))
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the code, the output file will be the same. When you use
<code>format</code>, the <code>{}</code> gets replaced by the data. It is equivalent to the
<code>str(data)</code> that we have used before. However, imagine that you want to
output all the values with the same amount of characters, you can
replace that last line by:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">f.write('{:.2f}\n'.format(data))
</code></pre>
<p>which will give you values like <code>0.00</code>, <code>0.01</code>, etc. What you put in
between the <code>{}</code> is the format string, which instructs Python how to
transform your numbers into strings. In this case, it is telling it to
treat the numbers as fixed point with 2 decimals. In principle, it looks
very nice, but notice that you are losing information. The values like
<code>0.005</code> are rounded to <code>0.01</code>. Therefore, you have to be very certain
about what do you want to achieve, in order not to lose important
information. If you are performing an experiment with 0.1 precision, you
don't care about 0.005, but if it is not the case, you have lost half
your information.</p>
<p>Proper formatting takes a bit of tinkering. Since we want to store at
least three decimals, we should change the line to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">f.write('{:.3f}\n'.format(data))
</code></pre>
<p>Now you are storing all the decimals up to the third place. Formatting
strings deserve a post on its own. But you can see the basic options
here. If you are working with integers, for instance, or with larger
floating point numbers (not between 0 and 1), you may want to specify
how much space the numbers are going to take. For instance, you can try:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0,100,201)
with open('BC_data.dat', 'w') as f:
    for data in x:
        f.write('{:4.1f}\n'.format(data))
</code></pre>
<p>This command is letting Python know that each number should be allocated
4 spaces in total, with only one decimal place. Since the first numbers
have only 3 characters (<code>0.5</code>), there will be a space preceding the
number. Later on, <code>10.0</code> will start right from the beginning, and the
decimals will be nicely aligned. However, you will notice that <code>100.0</code>
is displaced by one position (it takes 5, not 4 spaces).</p>
<p>You can play a lot with the formatting. You can align the information to
the left or to the right, adding spaces or any other character on either
side, etc. I promise to cover this topic later on. But for now it is
enough, let's keep storing data to a file.</p>
<h2>Storing Data in Columns</h2>
<p>Let's recover the example from before, where we stored two columns of
data. We would like to do the same, without the use of numpy's
<code>savetxt</code>. With what we know of formatting we can already do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0,100,201)
y = np.random.random(201)

with open('BD_data.dat', 'w') as f:
    for i in range(len(x)):
        f.write('{:4.1f} {:.4f}\n'.format(x[i], y[i]))
</code></pre>
<p>Check the saved file, you will see the two columns of data, separated by
a space. You can change the <code>write</code> line in different ways, for example,
you could have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">f.write('{:4.1f}\t{:.4f}\n'.format(x[i], y[i]))
</code></pre>
<p>which will add a tab between the columns, and not a space. You can
structure your file as you like. However, you have to be careful and
think ahead about how you are going to retrieve the data in case an
inconsistency appears.</p>
<h2>Reading the data</h2>
<p>After we have saved the data to a file, it is very important to be able
to read it back into our program. The first approach is unorthodox, but
it will prove a point. You can read the data generated with the <code>write</code>
method using numpy's <code>loadtxt</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

data = np.loadtxt('BD_data.dat')
</code></pre>
<p>One of the advantages of writing text files is that they are relatively
easy to read from any other program. Even your text editor can make
sense of what is inside one of such files. Of course, you can also read
the file without using numpy, just with Python's built-in methods. The
easiest would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('BD_data.dat', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
</code></pre>
<p>However, if you look into data, you will notice that it is a string.
After all, plain text files are just strings. Depending on how you have
structured the file, transforming the data into an array, a list, etc.
may be more or less simple. However, before going into those details,
another way of reading the file is line by line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('BD_data.dat', 'r') as f:
    data = f.readline()
    data_2 = f.readline()
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>data</code> will hold the header, because it is the first line
of the file, while <code>data_2</code> will hold the first line of data. Of course,
this only reads the first two lines of the file. To read all the lines,
we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('BD_data.dat', 'r') as f:
    line = f.readline()
    header = []
    data = []
    while line:
        if line.startswith('#'):
            header.append(line)
        else:
            data.append(line)
        line = f.readline()
</code></pre>
<p>Now you see that things are getting more complicated. After opening the
file, we read the first line and then we enter into a loop, that will
keep running while there are more lines in the file. We start two empty
lists to hold the header and the data information. For each line, we
check whether it starts with <code>#</code>, which would correspond to the header
(or comment). We append the rest of the lines to <code>data</code>.</p>
<p>If you look into the <code>data</code> variable, you will notice that it is not
very usable. If you are reading the example with the two columns, you
will see that <code>data</code> is a list in which every element looks like
<code>0.0\t0.02994\n</code>. If we want to reconstruct the information we had
before, we have to reverse the procedure of writing. The first thing to
note is that both values are separated by a <code>\t</code>, therefore our code
would look like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('BD_data.dat', 'r') as f:
    line = f.readline()
    header = []
    x = []
    y = []
    while line:
        if line.startswith('#'):
            header.append(line)
        else:
            data = line.split('\t')
            x.append(float(data[0]))
            y.append(float(data[1]))
        line = f.readline()
</code></pre>
<p>The beginning looks the same, but we have separated the data into <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code>. The biggest modification, in this case, is that we apply the
method <code>split</code> to separate a string. Since our columns are delimited by
a tab, we use the character <code>\t</code>. Data will have two elements, i.e. two
columns, and we append each to x and y. Of course, we don't want the
strings, but the numbers. That is why we transform <code>data</code> into floats.</p>
<p>With the steps above you can see that it is possible to recover the
functionality of the <code>loadtxt</code> of numpy, but with a lot of effort. The
code above works only if you have two columns if you had a file with
just 1 column, or with more than 2 it would fail. <code>loadtxt</code> didn't ask
explicitly how many columns to expect, it just parsed the text and found
out by itself. However, you will not always have numpy available, or
sometimes you require a higher level of control on how your data is
being read or written.</p>
<h2>Learning From Others</h2>
<p>One of the main advantages of open-source software is that you are free
to look into their code in order to understand what they do and learn
from them. In the example above, we have developed a very specialized
solution that is able to handle two columns, but not more nor less.
However, when we are using <code>loadtxt</code>, we don't need to specify how many
columns there are, the method will find out by itself. Let's look at the
<a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.15.0/numpy/lib/npyio.py#L773-L1149">loadtxt
code</a>
to try to understand how it works and improve our own code.</p>
<p>The first you have to notice is that the method <code>loadtxt</code>, including
comments, is 376 lines long, quite a big difference with our
10-line-long method for reading two columns. In <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.15.0/numpy/lib/npyio.py#L1054">line
1054</a>
you can find <code>first_vals = split_line(first_line)</code>, which sends you to
<a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.15.0/numpy/lib/npyio.py#L991">line
991</a>,
in which numpy defines how to split the lines. You see that it is simply
doing <code>line.split(delimiter)</code> and <code>delimiter</code> could be <code>None</code> (it comes
from the very line where <code>loadtxt</code> is defined). Looking at that line
takes you to the official Python docs, in which you can see the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str.split">documentation for
split</a>.</p>
<p>What we could do is to look for the first line with data, split it
either with a fixed delimiter or we can let Python do its best by using
<code>None</code>. Once we read the first line, we will know how many columns are
present, and we assume that all the other lines will have the same
number. If it is not the case, we could raise an exception because of
malformed data. Note that <code>loadtxt</code> also takes care of parsing the
element as the proper data type. We assume we are dealing with floats,
and we have used <code>float(data[0])</code>, which will fail if we try to load a
string.</p>
<p>Loading data in a flexible way such as what numpy does is relatively
complex. The advantage of looking at code developed by others is that
you can learn a lot from seasoned developers, you can see that they
anticipate problems you perhaps never thought about. You could also
implement the same method, without relying on having numpy on the same
computer. Whenever you think you are doing something that it was already
solved, try to leverage from that experience. Reading code is a great
resource for learning.</p>
<h2>Saving Non-Numeric Data</h2>
<p>So far we have dealt only with numbers, that is why using numpy provides
such a big advantage. However, a lot of applications need to deal with
different types of data. Let's start with the easiest one: storing
strings. There is a very popular dataset for people learning machine
learning, known as the Iris Dataset. It consists of observations of
several parameters of three different types of flowers.</p>
<p>I am not going to recreate the dataset here, but I will just use it as
inspiration. Imagine you make several observations, each corresponding
to a specific flower out of three options. However, not all of the
observations are real, some were labeled as fake ones. We can create a
file very easily, with some random data:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import random

observations = ['Real', 'Fake']
flowers = ['Iris setosa', 'Iris virginica', 'Iris versicolor']

with open('DA_data.dat', 'w') as f:
    for _ in range(20):
        observation = random.choice(observations)
        flower = random.choice(flowers)
        f.write('{} {}\n'.format(observation, flower))
</code></pre>
<p>There are two types of observations, with three different types of
flowers. You pick one random type of observation and one random flower
and you write it to the file. Of course, we don't need to limit
ourselves to string data. We can also save numeric values. The original
dataset includes four numeric values: the length and the width of the
sepals and petals. We can include some fake data modifying the script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import random

observations = ['Real', 'Fake']
flowers = ['Iris setosa', 'Iris virginica', 'Iris versicolor']

with open('DB_data.dat', 'w') as f:
    for _ in range(20):
        observation = random.choice(observations)
        flower = random.choice(flowers)
        sepal_width = random.random()
        sepal_length = random.random()
        petal_width = random.random()
        petal_length = random.random()

        f.write('{} {} {:.3f} {:.3f} {:.3f} {:.3f}\n'.format(
            observation,
            flower,
            sepal_length,
            sepal_width,
            petal_length,
            petal_width))
</code></pre>
<p>If you look at the file, you will see that you have the same information
as before, plus the extra four numeric fields. Probably, you are already
seeing the limitations of the approach. But let's see it in more detail.</p>
<h2>Reading Non-Numeric Data</h2>
<p>Just as before, reading non-numeric data is as easy as reading numeric
data. For example, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('DB_data.dat', 'r') as f:
    line = f.readline()
    data = []
    while line:
        data.append(line.split(' '))
        line = f.readline()
print(data)
</code></pre>
<p>You see that we are splitting the spaces, which seemed like a good idea
in the examples above. However, if you look closely at the data, you
will notice that the names of the flowers are split, and we end up with
lines of 6 elements instead of 5 as expected. This is a simple example
because every field has exactly one space, and therefore we can merge
together the two that belong to the name.</p>
<p>More complicated data, like sentences, for example, will require a more
careful handling. In a sentence, you will have a variable number of
spaces and therefore you are going to have a hard time figuring out what
parts belong to which data column. You can replace the space by a comma
when you save the file and it is going to work, provided that there are
no commas in the data you are saving.</p>
<p>If you delimit your data with commas you will have a file commonly
referred to as Comma Separated Values, or <strong>csv</strong>. You can see the
output of <a href="https://github.com/PFTL/website/blob/master/example_code/13_storing_data/DB_data.csv">the file I have
generated</a>
on Github. This kind of files can be interpreted not only by text
readers but also by numeric programs such as Excel, Libre Office,
Matlab, etc. You can even see that if you look at the file on Github it
appears nicely formatted. There are several standards around, and you
can try to reproduce them.</p>
<p>Of course, if your data has a comma in it, the file will be broken. The
integrity of your data will be fine, but it is going to be very hard to
specify how to read it back without errors. The idea of storing data is
that you can read back, and if there are exceptions in the process, you
will not be certain about what your data means. You don't need to use
commas, nor single characters. You can separate your data with a dot and
a comma, for instance.</p>
<p>When you store data, you have to think not only about the process of
storing but also in the process of reading it back in an unambiguous
way. If you store only numeric data, choosing a letter for separating
values may seem like a good idea. Using a comma may seem correct until
you realize that in some countries commas separate the decimal part of
numbers.</p>
<p>Is this all regarding how to store data? Of course, not, there is much
more to come.</p>
