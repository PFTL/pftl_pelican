              <p>This tutorial is going to be off-topic compared to the others on the
website. It was born out of a question regarding how to send
personalized e-mails to several people on a list, and I thought it could
be useful to post a tutorial online. This will help people interested in
building a simple Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) and it will also
show scientists that the skills they develop while working in the lab
can be used in various contexts.</p>
<p>Let's first discuss what we want to achieve. A CRM is a tool that allows
users to send e-mails to customers and keep track of their answers. It
could be much more complex than that, integrating with a phone, social
media accounts, billing platforms, etc. but for our purposes, we will
keep it to what a normal person (like me) needs. It should be able to
send the same e-mail to several people but with a certain degree of
personalization, for example, saying <em>Dear John</em> instead of a generic
<em>Dear Customer</em>.</p>
<p>The CRM should prevent me from sending the same e-mail twice to the same
person and should be able to show me all the e-mails I have exchanged
with that person. It should also allow me to segment customers, making
it possible for me to send e-mails just to groups of people, for
example, the ones who took the Python For The Lab course and those who
are interested in it. The ones who bought the book and those who only
asked for the free chapter, etc. Let's get started!</p>
<h2>The Choices</h2>
<p>First, we will need a way of sending and receiving e-mail. If you are a
GMail user, you can check <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7104828?hl=en">this
guide</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-google-s-smtp-server">this
other
one</a>
on how to set up the server (you will need this information later on, so
keep it in hand). If you want to use a custom domain to send and receive
e-mail, I strongly suggest you use
<a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?181470/promo/dreamsavings50/">Dreamhost</a>
which is what I use myself (if you use the link, you will get a 50U\$
discount and at the same time you will help me keep this website
running). If you expect to send more than 100 e-mails per hour, I
suggest you check <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/">Amazon SES</a> which is
very easy to set up and has reasonable pricing.</p>
<p>Next, we need to define how to send e-mails. The fact that we are going
to use Python is out of the question. But here we have several choices
to make. I believe the best is to use Jupyter notebooks. They have the
advantage of allowing you to run different pieces of code, see the
output inline, etc. It is easier to have interaction through a Jupyter
notebook than through plain scripts. Building a user interface (either a
desktop app or a web app) would be too time-consuming for a minimum
increase in usability.</p>
<p>We have now a web server, a platform, we only need to define how to
store the data. For this, I will choose SQLite. I have written in the
past about how to <a href="15_Storing_data_3.rst.md">store data using SQLite</a>, but
in this article, we are going one step further by introducing an ORM, or
Object Relational Mapping, which will greatly simplify our work when
defining tables, accessing data, etc.</p>
<h2>Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
<p>If you are familiar with the Jupyter notebooks, just skip this section
and head to the next one. If you are not familiar with them, I will give
you a very quick introduction. First, you need to install the needed
package. If you are an Anaconda user, you have Jupyter by default. If
you are not, you should start by creating a <a href="03_Virtual_Environment.rst.md">Virtual
Environment</a>, and then do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install jupyter
</code></pre>
<p>The installation will take some time because there are many packages to
download, but don't worry, it will be over soon. Then, you can simply
run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">jupyter notebook
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not inside a virtual environment, or the command above fails,
you can also try the following command, directly on your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python -m jupyter notebook
</code></pre>
<p>After you run the command, your web browser should open. Bear in mind
that you will use as base folder the folder where you run the command
above. Just select new from the top-right button and start a new Python
3 notebook.</p>
<p>You should be welcomed by a screen like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Empty Jupyter Notebook" class="center-img" src="/images/27_images/01_jupyter.jpg"></p>
<p>The arrow indicates the name of the notebook. You can edit it to
something more descriptive than Untitled. For example,
<strong>Test_Notebook</strong>. The line that you see in green is where your input
should go. Let's try a simple print statement, like what you see in the
image below. To run the code, you can either press Shift+Enter or click
the play button that says run, while the cursor is still in the cell.</p>
<p><img alt="First Cell" class="center-img" src="/images/27_images/02_jupyter.jpg"></p>
<p>The advantage of Jupyter notebooks is that they also keep the output
when you share them. You can see <a href="https://github.com/PFTL/website/blob/master/example_code/27_CRM/Test_Notebook.ipynb">this example
notebook</a>
on Github. And they allow you to embed markdown text in order to
document what you are doing.</p>
<p>If you haven't used Jupyter notebooks before, now it is a great chance
to get started. They are very useful for prototyping code that later can
become an independent program. From now on, I will not stress every
single time that the code should go into a notebook, but you should
assume it.</p>
<p>As always, all the code for this project <a href="https://github.com/PFTL/website/tree/master/example_code/27_CRM">can be found
here</a>.
The majority of the code that goes into the Jupyter notebooks can also
be copy-pasted into plain Python script files. Just keep in mind that
the order in which you can run cells is up to you and not necessarily
from top to bottom as is the case for scripts.</p>
<h2>Sending Email</h2>
<p>The most basic function of any customer relationship manager is to be
able to send e-mails. Having just this functionality is already useful
in a lot of different situations, not only professionally but also for
private tasks. For example, you can invite your friends to a party by
addressing them by name: '<em>Dear Brian,</em>'. In order to be able to send
e-mails, you need to be able to configure an SMTP server.</p>
<p>If you are a Google User you can check <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-google-s-smtp-server">this
guide</a>,
or you can <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?181470/promo/dreamsavings50/">sign up to
Dreamhost</a>
or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/">Amazon Services</a>. If you want to use a
custom domain, the Dreamhost way is the easiest and quickest. You can
read the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038-Email-client-configuration-overview">documentation for configuring your
e-mail</a>.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating a configuration file in which we will store some
useful parameters. Create an empty file in the same directory where you
will be working and call it <strong>config.yml</strong>. You can use Jupyter to
create this file, just select <em>Text File</em> after clicking on <em>New</em>. And
in the file, put the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">EMAIL:
  username: my_username
  password: my_password
  port: 1234
  smtp_server: smtp.server
</code></pre>
<p>The format of this file is called YAML, which is a very simple markup
language in which blocks are indented by <strong>2 spaces</strong>. Replace the
different variables by what you need, i.e., replace <code>my_username</code> with
the username of your server, etc. My choice of putting this information
on a different file is that now I can share my Jupyter notebooks without
exposing my password. In order to work with YAML files in Python, you
will need to install <code>pyyaml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install pyyaml
</code></pre>
<p>Now we are ready to start. Let's create a new Python notebook. Let's
call it, for example, <strong>simple_crm</strong>. The first thing to do is to load
the configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">import pyyaml

with open('config.yml', 'r') as config_file:
    config = yaml.load(config_file)
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not familiar with the <code>with</code> command you can check <a href="16_context_manager.rst.md">this
article about the context manager</a>. If you want
to explore how your variable <code>config</code> looks like, you can simply write
it in a different cell and press Ctrl+Enter. The result is a dictionary
with the needed parameters for sending e-mail. So, let's get to it.</p>
<p>First, let's compose a short message and subject:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">msg_sbj = 'Testing my brand new CRM with Jupyter notebooks'
msg_text = '''This is the body of the message that will be sent.\n
Even if basic, it will prove the point.\n\n
Hope to hear again from you!'''
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the way of composing the message requires to import a special
module of Python called <code>email</code>. The code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

me = &quot;Aquiles &lt;my@from.com&gt;&quot;
you = &quot;Aquiles &lt;your@to.com&gt;&quot;
msg = MIMEMultipart()
msg['From'] = me
msg['To'] = you
msg['Subject'] = msg_sbj
msg.attach(MIMEText(msg_text, 'plain'))
</code></pre>
<p>We first create a <code>msg</code>, which will be ready to send both plain and HTML
e-mails. We specify the <code>from</code>, <code>to</code>, and <code>subject</code> of the email.
Remember that if you specify the wrong <code>from</code>, your message has a high
chance of being filtered either by your SMTP provider or the receiver's
server as spam. Be sure you use the proper e-mail from-address that you
have configured.</p>
<p>The last line attaches the plain version of the e-mail to the message.
We will see that it is also possible to send more complex messages, with
a plain text version and an HTML version. Now that we have our e-mail
ready, we need to send it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">import smtplib

with smtplib.SMTP(config['EMAIL']['smtp_server'], config['EMAIL']['port']) as s:
    s.ehlo()
    s.login(config['EMAIL']['username'],config['EMAIL']['password'])
    s.sendmail(me, you, msg.as_string())
    s.quit()
</code></pre>
<p>First, you see that we start the SMTP connection using the configuration
parameters that were defined on the <strong>config.yml</strong> file. The <code>ehlo</code>
command is a way of telling the server <em>hello</em> and start the exchange of
information. We then log in and finally send the message. See that we
defined both the sender and receiver twice: they are used in the
<code>sendmail</code> command, but also they are defined within the <code>msg</code> object.</p>
<p>If you used real e-mails, you should by now receive the example message.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Sometimes GMail does not deliver messages that you send to yourself from
different aliases. If nothing arrives, you can try to send an e-mail to
a different address which you control.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, imagine you would like to personalize the message before sending
it. For example, we would like to address the recipient by name. We can
improve our message, to make it look like a template, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">msg_text = '''Hello {name},
This is the body of the message that will be sent.
Even if basic, it will prove the point.
Hope to hear again from you!'''
</code></pre>
<p>And you can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">msg_text.format(name='Aquiles')
</code></pre>
<p>Which will output the message exactly as you expected. If you now would
like to send a message to different people, you could simply do a
for-loop. Remember that before generating the message body, you replace
the name by the name of your contact as shown in the code above.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>I will not go into the details of how to implement the loop because we
will work on this later on, in a much more complete solution.</p>
</div>
<h2>Adding HTML to the message</h2>
<p>Now it is time to make your messages more beautiful by adding HTML to
them. Coding HTML e-mails is a complicated subject because there are
many things to take into account. First, e-mail clients work differently
from each other, meaning that the way your e-mail is displayed depends
on how it is opened. Screen sizes change, and therefore your e-mail
should have a fixed width or it will look very ugly on some devices.
Being aware of these problems, I would suggest you check ready-made
templates developed by designers who took care of all of this.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are going to use
<a href="https://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/">Cerberus</a> which, among other
things, is open source and free. If you unzip the contents, you will
find 3 important files: <strong>cerberus-fluid.html</strong>,
<strong>cerberus-responsive.html</strong>, and <strong>cerberus-hybrid.html</strong>. Those are
three different templates which you can use. We are going to use the
responsive version.</p>
<p>You should open the files with your browser in order to have an idea of
how they look. Also, check the source code to understand how you can
utilize different elements, change the color, etc. The documentation is
your best friend. I have stripped down a bit the template. You can find
it
<a href="https://github.com/PFTL/website/blob/master/example_code/27_CRM/base_email.html">here</a>.
For practical purposes it doesn't really matter, you can use the
original also.</p>
<p>What we will do is keep the e-mail template as a separated file, so we
don't pollute the notebook that much. In order to add it to our message,
we need to do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">with open('base_email.html') as f:
    msg_html = f.read()
</code></pre>
<p>And then, the only two things we need to add to the message is the
following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">msg = MIMEMultipart('alternative')
msg.attach(MIMEText(msg_html, 'html'))
</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention that we need to initialize the message with the argument
<code>'alternative'</code>. If we fail to do this, the message will include both
the text and the HTML versions one after the other.</p>
<p>The idea of attaching both the text and the HTML version of the e-mail
is that we keep in mind that not all people accept HTML messages. You
can configure most e-mail clients to use only plain text messages. This
is a good way of preventing trackers from spying on you and makes
e-mails easier to read. Moreover, it can make phishing attempts easier
to spot.</p>
<p>The e-mail, if you attach both versions, will be shown as HTML if the
client supports it and will fall back to the text version if it doesn't.
In general lines, we can say that adding HTML versions of your messages
is up to you, adding the text version should be mandatory.</p>
<h2>Receiving Email</h2>
<p>Sending e-mails is half of what a CRM should do. The other half is
checking e-mails. This will allow the system to store messages
associated with the people with whom you interact. This will allow you
to check, for example, who never replied to your questions. We will
start by updating the configuration file since we now need to add the
POP3 server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">EMAIL:
  username: my_username
  password: my_password
  port: 1234
  smtp_server: smtp.server
  pop_server: pop.server
</code></pre>
<p>If you would need a different username or password for the POP server,
you can add them also to the config file. Remember that you will need to
reload the configuration file in order to have the new variable
available.</p>
<p>Reading from the server is relatively easy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">import poplib
server = poplib.POP3(config['EMAIL']['pop_server'])
server.user(config['EMAIL']['username'])
server.pass_(config['EMAIL']['password'])
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the block again and it works out correctly, you will see the
following message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">b'+OK Logged in.'
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to download the list of messages that are available on the
server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">resp, items, octets = server.list()
</code></pre>
<p>Bear in mind that if there are no messages available, you won't be able
to do anything else. You can always send one or more e-mails to yourself
in order to test the code. Items will hold information regarding the
available messages. If you explore the <code>items</code> variable, you will see an
output like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">[b'1 34564', b'2 23746', b'3 56465']
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the server has 3 available messages. The first number is
the id of the message, while the second is its size. If we want to
retrieve the first message, for example, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">msg = server.retr('1')
</code></pre>
<p>If you explore the <code>msg</code>, you will see it is a tuple with 3 elements.
The message itself is stored in <code>msg[1]</code>. However, it is a list, full of
information regarding the message you have downloaded. Without going
into too much detail, first, you need to transform the list into a
single array, and then we can use the mail tools to parse the
information into a usable format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">import email

raw_email = b'\n'.join(msg[1])
parsed_email = email.message_from_bytes(raw_email)
</code></pre>
<p>You are free to explore each step independently to try to understand
what is available in your message. The <code>parsed_email</code> has a lot of
information, not only regarding who sent the message and to whom but
also the server used, spam filtering options, etc. We would like to show
the contents of the e-mail, both the HTML and the text formats, so we
can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">for part in parsed_email.walk():
    if part.get_content_type() == 'text/plain':
        print(part.get_payload()) # prints the raw text
</code></pre>
<p>This will go through all the available information in the message, and
if it finds it is of type <code>text/plain</code>, it will print it to the screen.
You can change it to <code>text/html</code> and it will show the other version, if
available.</p>
<p>As you can see, retrieving e-mails is relatively more complex than
sending e-mails. There are also some other concerns regarding what you
do with the messages you downloaded. For example, you can leave them on
the server, thus they will be available from other clients as well. You
can also choose to delete them from the server after reading, etc. Each
pattern has advantages and disadvantages, so that will be up to the
workflow you are considering.</p>
<p>The code up to here can be found on <a href="https://github.com/PFTL/website/blob/master/example_code/27_CRM/simple_CRM_01.ipynb">this
notebook</a>.
Now we are going to focus a bit more onto expanding the usability of our
tools.</p>
<h2>Using a Database</h2>
<p>In the previous sections, we have seen how you can send and receive
e-mails with Python directly from a Jupyter notebook. Now it is time to
focus onto a different topic. It is important when you want to establish
relationships with customers, to have a way of storing information
persistently. For example, you would like to keep an agenda of contacts,
you would like to know when was the last time you contacted someone,
etc.</p>
<p>In order to achieve a high level of flexibility, we are going to use a
database to store all our information. Fortunately, Python supports
SQLite databases out of the box. We have discussed about them in a
<a href="https://pythonforthelab.com/blog/storing-data-with-sqlite">different article</a> that may be
useful for you to check if you want to dig into the details. We are
going to use a library called SQLAlchemy, which will allow us to define
relationships between elements much faster. You can install it like any
other Python package:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install sqlalchemy
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing we will do is creating a new notebook to explore how to
use the database from within Jupyter. Let's start by importing all the
needed modules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create the database engine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">engine = create_engine('sqlite:///crm.db', echo=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the engine supports other types of databases, not only SQLite.
However, SQLite is by far the easiest to work with for small
applications such as ours.</p>
<p>We also define a declarative base, that will allow us to define classes
that will be mapped to tables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">Base = declarative_base()
</code></pre>
<p>Now it is time to define what information we want to store to the
database. For the CRM it seems reasonable to start by defining
customers. The advantage of using SQLAlchemy is that instead of working
directly on the database, we can do that through the engine and the
base. To define what information we want to store, we have to define a
class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">class Customer(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'customers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    last_name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)

    def __repr__(self):
        return &quot;&lt;Customer(name='{}', last_name='{}', email='{}')&gt;&quot;.format(
        self.name, self.last_name, self.email)
</code></pre>
<p>I think the code above it is self-explanatory. We define the name of the
table we want to use. Each attribute defined with <code>Column</code> will be
transformed into a column in the table, of the specified type, in our
case we have <code>Integer</code> for <code>id</code> and <code>String</code> for all the rest. In order
to create the table, we have to run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
</code></pre>
<p>You will see a lot of content appearing on the screen. If you are
familiar with SQL you will notice the commands that are being executed.
Now what we have is a very nice relationship between a class
(<code>Customer</code>) and a table (<code>customers</code>) on our database. Let's create our
first customer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">first_customer = Customer(name='Aquiles', last_name='Carattino', email='aquiles@uetke.com')
</code></pre>
<p>And now we need to add it to the database. This is achieved through the
creation of a session:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
</code></pre>
<p>The last step is to add the customer to the database:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">session.add(ed_user)
session.commit()
</code></pre>
<p>And that is all. If you know how to explore the database with an
external tool, you will see the data that we have just added. You can
follow the steps above for as many customers as you want. To retrieve
information from the database, we can use the session and the <code>Customer</code>
class directly. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">one_customer = session.query(Customer).filter_by(name='Aquiles').first()
print(one_customer)
</code></pre>
<p>It will give you as output the information of your customer. Pay
attention to the fact that when you filter in this way, the options are
case sensitive. We will not cover all the details regarding how to use
SQLAlchemy, especially because <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/index.html">their
documentation</a> is very
extensive, but it is important to see how to search with partial
information, for example looking by parts of the name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">one_customer = session.query(Customer).filter(Customer.name.like('aqui%')).first()
</code></pre>
<p>This will find all customers with a name that starts with <code>aqui</code>,
regardless of their case. There is a detail that it is also very
important and that I haven't mentioned yet, the <code>first()</code> that appears
at the end. Let's see what happens if you have two customers in the
database, and they have similar names so that the command above gets
both of them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">second_customer = Customer(name='Aquileo', last_name='Doe', email='aquileo@doe.com')
session.add(second_customer)
session.commit()
</code></pre>
<p>Let's remove the <code>first()</code>, and let's run the same command as before:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">answer = session.query(Customer).filter(Customer.name.like('aqui%'))
print(answer)
</code></pre>
<p>Will give you as output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">&lt;sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query at 0x7f003da05390&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The answer is not a list of customers, but an object called Query. If
you want to go through each element, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">for c in answer:
    print(c)
</code></pre>
<p>The idea of the query is that it knows how many elements are there but
it didn't load the information to memory. This makes it incredibly handy
if you are working with very large databases.</p>
<p>With a bit of creativity, you can already merge what we learned before
in order to send e-mails to all the customers in your database. Before
discussing how to implement that, I would like to focus on one more
topic, which is how to add tags to the customers and keep track of the
sent messages.</p>
<h2>Database Relationships</h2>
<p>One of the features we want to have in our CRM is to be able to keep
track of the sent messages, so we can avoid sending twice the same
e-mail to the same person, or we can check how long it was since we sent
the last message, etc. We will define a new class called <code>Message</code> in
which we will hold the information of every message sent. It will look
like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">from sqlalchemy import Text, Date, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Message(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'messages'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    text = Column(Text)
    date = Column(Date)

    customer_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('customers.id'))
    customer = relationship(&quot;Customer&quot;, back_populates=&quot;messages&quot;)

    def __repr__(self):
        return &quot;&lt;Message(name='{}', date='{}', customer='{}')&gt;&quot;.format(
        self.name, self.date, self.customer)
</code></pre>
<p>Bear in mind that the imports complement the ones of the previous
section, they do not replace the others but are new for this piece of
code. The beginning is very similar to the previous class, but the main
difference is the part referring to the customers. Each message will be
sent to a specific customer. To make this bridge, we use the
<code>ForeignKey</code>. This means that the value that is going to be stored in
<code>customer_id</code> has to be an existing customer id. In this way, we can add
more dimensions to our plain tables.</p>
<p>The <code>relationship</code> is a way of telling SQLAlchemy where the data is
going to be accessed. Having the id of the customer is handy, but it is
better if we have direct access to the information. In such a case, if
we would like to know the name of the customer who got the message, we
can do something like <code>message.customer.name</code>. The opposite relationship
is also valid, and we need to add it. We can simply do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">Customer.messages = relationship('Message', order_by=Message.id, back_populates='customer').
</code></pre>
<p>And then you just need to update the engine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's create some messages to understand how we can use this new
strategy. We first need to get at least one customer, so we can assign
the messages to it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">from datetime import datetime

c = session.query(Customer).first()
new_message = Message(name='Welcome', text='Welcome to the new CRM', date=datetime.now(), customer=c)
session.add(new_message)
session.commit()
</code></pre>
<p>We get the first customer from the table, and then we create a new
message. This is just an example, but in principle, the variable <code>text</code>
could be much longer. If we want to retrieve this message from the
database, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">message = session.query(Message).first()
print(message)
</code></pre>
<p>And now you will see that you have the information not only about this
message but also about the customer to whom the message was sent. You
can also try the other way around, see all the messages sent to a
particular customer, by doing the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">c = session.query(Customer).first()
print(c.messages)
</code></pre>
<p>And you will get a list of all the messages that were sent. Now you have
an idea of how this can very quickly start to be a useful tool, not just
a mere exercise.</p>
<p>The relationship between messages and customers is called many-to-one
because a customer can have many messages associated with it, but each
message will be associated with a single customer. There is also another
relationship possible, which is called many-to-many. This would be the
case of having lists of customers. A customer can belong to several
lists, and at the same time, each list can contain several customers.</p>
<p>If you think that a database is nothing more than a collection of tables
in which each entry has a unique identifier, you will realize that there
is no way of making this many-to-many between two tables directly. We
will need to define an intermediate table which will hold these
relationships. First, let's start by the list itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">class List(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'lists'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
</code></pre>
<p>And now we need to create the intermediate table:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">from sqlalchemy import Table

association_table = Table('list_customer', Base.metadata,
    Column('left_id', Integer, ForeignKey('customers.id')),
    Column('right_id', Integer, ForeignKey('lists.id'))
)

Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
</code></pre>
<p>See, that it is a table that has two columns each with a foreign key,
one for the customer and one for the list.</p>
<p>We can do the same we did earlier in order to be able to use
<code>customer.lists</code> to get the lists to which the customer is subscribed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">Customer.lists = relationship(&quot;List&quot;,
                    secondary=association_table,
                    backref=&quot;customers&quot;)

Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
</code></pre>
<p>And now, it is time to create a list, append a user and save it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">c_list = List(name='New List')
customer = session.query(Customer).first()
c_list.customers.append(customer)
session.add(c_list)
session.commit()
</code></pre>
<p>Remember not to use a plain <code>list</code> variable, since it is a Python
keyword. I think it is pretty clear what is going on. Finally, if you
want to retrieve a list and find the customers subscribed to it, you
would do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">las_list = session.query(List).first()
print(las_list.customers)
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, you can check the lists to which a user is
subscribed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">print(customer.lists)
</code></pre>
<p>See that the output of this last command is not particularly nice. This
is because we haven't defined a specific <code>__repr__</code> method as we have
done for the other classes.</p>
<p>With this, we are done regarding how to use databases to store
information. Now it is time to get into the action. The full code
discussed in this section can be found on <a href="https://github.com/PFTL/website/blob/master/example_code/27_CRM/simple_crm_02.ipynb">this
notebook</a>.
Now it is time to clean up the code in order to make more usable and
extendable.</p>
<h2>Sending To All Customers</h2>
<p>The notebook that we have developed in the previous section is very
dirty. We have been adding features on the fly, without really worrying
about how easy it is to understand it. Imports were scattered all over
the place, classes get modified at runtime, etc. An example of a cleaned
up notebook can be <a href="https://github.com/PFTL/website/blob/master/example_code/27_CRM/simple_CRM_03_clean_db.ipynb">found
here</a>.
I won't enter into the details, you are free to use it.</p>
<p>We are going to focus now a bit more on usability. How can we send the
e-mail to all our customers, using what we've learned in the first
section and combining it with what we've developed in the previous one?
We will start a new notebook. The first thing we need is to have
available all the classes to interface with the database. We start the
new notebook like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">%run clean_db.ipynb
</code></pre>
<p>in this case, you need to change <code>clean_db</code> by whatever name you have
given to the notebook that created the database. The command above is
equivalent to inserting the notebook at the beginning and running it.
Therefore, all the variables, classes, functions, etc. that you have
developed are going to be available.</p>
<p>Now we need to be able to send a message to all our customers. We can
develop a function that will take care of the sending of e-mails:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def send_all():
    customers = session.query(Customer)
    for customer in customers:
        message = customer.create_msg('Message_name', 'template_file')
        message.send(config)
        session.add(message)
        session.commit()
</code></pre>
<p>At this stage this is not sending any message, it is just showing how it
would look like. The code above implements a lot of different choices on
how to find a solution. One is that we would like the <code>Customer</code> class
that creates a message, and the message is able to send itself. Then we
store that message into the database. This prevents adding messages to
the database if the sending fails. The <code>Customer</code> class will look like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Customer(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'customers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    last_name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)

    def create_msg(self, message_name, template_file):
        with open(template_file, 'r') as template:
            text = template.format(name=self.name)
        message = Message(name=message_name, text=text, customer=self, date=datetime.now())
        return message

    def __repr__(self):
        return &quot;&lt;Customer(name='{}', last_name='{}', email='{}')&gt;&quot;.format(
        self.name, self.last_name, self.email)
</code></pre>
<p>You see that we have only added the method <code>create_msg</code> which returns a
new message, after formatting the test. Then, we need to update the
message class to be able to send itself to a customer. We can do the
following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Message(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'messages'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    text = Column(Text)
    date = Column(Date)

    customer_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('customers.id'))
    customer = relationship(&quot;Customer&quot;, back_populates=&quot;messages&quot;)

    def send(self, config):
        me = config['me']
        you = '{} &lt;{}&gt;'.format(self.customer.name, self.customer.email)
        msg = MIMEMultipart('alternative')
        msg['From'] = me
        msg['To'] = you
        msg['Subject'] = self.name
        msg.attach(MIMEText(self.text, 'plain'))
        with smtplib.SMTP(config['EMAIL']['smtp_server'], config['EMAIL']['port']) as s:
            s.ehlo()
            s.login(config['EMAIL']['username'],config['EMAIL']['password'])
            s.sendmail(me, you, msg.as_string())

    def __repr__(self):
        return &quot;&lt;Message(name='{}', date='{}', customer='{}')&gt;&quot;.format(
            self.name, self.date, self.customer)
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that I have moved the <code>me</code> option into the config file. This
is something you will need to add by yourself in order to make it
compatible. It should look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">me: My Name &lt;my@email.com&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And should be top-level (i.e. not inside the <code>EMAIL</code> block). Since
sending the message needs to have the config available, we will run the
code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('config.yml', 'r') as config_file:
    config = yaml.load(config_file)
send_all()
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that when you change notebooks you need to save them, and then
you need to run the first block with the <code>%run</code> command again in order
to reflect the changes. We still need to work a bit on the <code>send_all</code>.
In the example above, we have fake names for the subject and the
template. We can improve that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def send_all(subject, template):
    customers = session.query(Customer)
    for customer in customers:
        message = customer.create_msg(subject, template)
        message.send(config)
        session.add(message)
        session.commit()
        print('Sent message {} to: {}'.format(subject, customer.email))
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's create a text file called <strong>test_email.txt</strong> with the
following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Hello {name},
Welcome to the test CRM.
Hope you are enjoying it!
</code></pre>
<p>And now, if we want to send the message to all our customers, we can do
the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">with open('config.yml', 'r') as config_file:
    config = yaml.load(config_file)
send_all('Testing the CMR', 'test_email.txt')
</code></pre>
<p>And now, you should see your messages being sent. You should also see
that the messages are personalized, replacing the name in the template
by the name of the customer getting the message. You can get as creative
as you want with these options. However, there is still an important
feature missing: send to a group of customers.</p>
<h2>Refactoring: Send to a list</h2>
<p>Since the amount of code we have developed is not that much, you can
still go through it and change it in all the needed places. But imagine
someone else has developed code that depends on what you have done. If
you change something as important as the number of arguments a function
takes, you will break the downstream code. In our case, we want to
change the <code>send_all</code> function in order to accept the name of a list as
an argument. However, we don't want to break the code that already uses
<code>send_all</code> with just two arguments (subject and template).</p>
<p>If you want to add a new argument to a function while making it
optional, there are two ways. One is to use the <code>*args</code> syntax, the
other is to use a default value. The latter is slightly easier to
understand for novice programmers. If we do the following to our
function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def send_all(subject, template, list_name='all'):
</code></pre>
<p>You will see that the code
<code>send_all('Testing the CMR', 'test_email.txt')</code> still works fine. So we
can now improve the function to get the customers that belong to a
certain list.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def send_all(subject, template, list_name='all'):
    if list_name == 'all':
        customers = session.query(Customer)
    else:
        customer_list = session.query(List).filter_by(name=list_name).first()
        customers = customer_list.customers
    for customer in customers:
        message = customer.create_msg(subject, template)
        message.send(config)
        session.add(message)
        session.commit()
        print('Sent message {} to: {}'.format(subject, customer.email))
</code></pre>
<p>So now, if you create a list of customers named <code>'Initial Customers'</code>,
for example, you can send a message to them by simply doing the
following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">send_all('Testing the CMR', 'test_email.txt', 'Initial Customers')
</code></pre>
<h2>Avoid repeating messages</h2>
<p>What you have seen up to now, should open the doors to a lot of very
nice creative approaches not only to CRM but to a variety of tasks that
you can automate with Python. The last feature that I would like to show
you is how to avoid sending the same message to the same person. You can
check it either when you create the message with the customer class, or
before sending it. Since it is normally a good idea to catch problems as
early as possible, let's improve the <code>Customer</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Customer(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'customers'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    last_name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)

    def create_msg(self, message_name, template_file):
        message_count = session.query(Message).filter_by(name=message_name, customer=self).count()
        if message_count &gt; 0:
            raise Exception('Message already sent')
        with open(template_file, 'r') as template:
            template = template.read()
            text = template.format(name=self.name)
        message = Message(name=message_name, text=text, customer=self, date=datetime.now())
        return message
</code></pre>
<p>The highlighted line is the important change to the <code>Customer</code> class.
Pay attention to the syntax. We filter both by the message name and the
customer who received the message. Then, we use the <code>count()</code> method,
which is the proper way of knowing how many results are available in the
database. It is much more efficient than getting all the results with
<code>all()</code> and then using the <code>len()</code> function. Anyways, if you try again
the <code>send_all</code> function, you will see that it fails if you try to send
the same message twice. Now, this is not exactly what we need. If you
want to send the message to the people who didn't get the message yet,
you would like to skip the people, not stop the execution.</p>
<p>In order to achieve that, we can <a href="https://pythonforthelab.com/blog/learning-not-to-handle-exceptions">handle the
exception</a>. But since we are
using a generic exception, we will handle everything in the same way,
regardless of whether it was raised because of an error in the database
or because the message was repeated. The best strategy is therefore to
create a custom exception:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">class MessageAlreadySent(Exception):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>And then the <code>Customer</code> can use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ipython3">if message_count &gt; 0:
    raise MessageAlreadySent('Message {} already sent to {}'.format(message_name, self.email))
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we can change the <code>send_all</code> in order to catch this specific
exception:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def send_all(subject, template, list_name='all'):
    if list_name == 'all':
        customers = session.query(Customer)
    else:
        customer_list = session.query(List).filter_by(name=list_name).first()
        customers = customer_list.customers
    for customer in customers:
        try:
            message = customer.create_msg(subject, template)
            message.send(config)
            session.add(message)
            session.commit()
            print('Sent message {} to: {}'.format(subject, customer.email))
        except MessageAlreadySent:
            print('Skipping {} because message already sent'.format(customer.email))
</code></pre>
<p>If the exception is <code>MessageAlreadySent</code> we will deal with it and will
skip the user. Bear in mind that since the exception appears with the
<code>customer.create_msg</code> line, the rest of the block is not executed, the
message is not created, nor added to the database. This guarantees that
if the exception is of a different kind, for example, the SMTP server is
not working, the database is broken, etc. the exception will not be
handled and the proper error will appear on the screen.</p>

notebook</a>,

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>This tutorial aims at showing you how you can quickly prototype
solutions by using <strong>Jupyter notebooks</strong>. They are not the proper tool
if you want to distribute the code as a package for others to use, but
it is very quick to find problems, run just what you need, etc.</p>
<p>Regarding the CRM itself, it is not complete yet. You can see it as a
minimum-viable-product. You can send e-mails to your customers, keep
track of what messages were sent when etc. Considering the amount of
work it took to set it up, you should be very satisfied.</p>
<p>The main objective of this tutorial was to show you how you can combine
different tools in order to build a new project. Of course, many things
can be improved, made more efficient, etc. The reality is that if you
need to handle communication with some hundreds of customers, you don't
need much more than what we did. Perhaps you can make it more
functional, prettier, etc. But that is more customization than core
development.</p>
